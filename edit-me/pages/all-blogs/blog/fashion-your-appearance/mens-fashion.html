#1)
Match them!

#2)
Trends/what's in style work... 
- The great power of association..

======
#3)
- create the V effect
- Shoulder bulk without warmth;
- --> brynje
- --> things that appear loose / tight
 fitting base layers *on top*


Indoor ideas;
- Vest + LS shirt combo
- Henley


#4) Fixing things
i.e. if you have a non-perfect part of your body
Examples:
- Slightly knock kneed
    -> Those looser fit stiff jeans that wrap around the leg
    -> Or... looser fit joggers etc...


----------------

# general
## Base
- Vest + open shirt over (ideally semi structured / wide shoulders..) 
- LS high neck tee
- Henley long sleeve. 

## keep on layer jacket? 
- wool shacket!? 

## Mid layers (indoor insulation)
(cheeky zip kneck? or does it just not lie very well on my body and no chance the neck will go all the way up and look normal?!?!?) 
- Shacket, Wool thickish at least 


## Top insulation layer 
- peacoat
- thicker brown wool shacket????

# some more principles
- Only things with buttoned wasted look good for tapering at waste.
- --> so two options for top layers; untapered short with big shoulders; tapered with button. (untapered just big in general and forget about body??)
- --> for mid layers; cardigans look weird, jumpers can't be tapered. ;; Peacoats look alright; too much = anything longer than thigh, epaulettes/overly complex double collars...
- --> Is a structured shoulder too much for an indoor item?!??!?!
- Nothing assymetrical allowed
- The less detail the better.
- nothing too light coloured
- nothing to rely detailed. 
- untapered overwear must have structured shoulder.
- Turntleknecks looks too weird

### mid layers 
- jumper (Including turtlenecks etc. any variant)
- wool vest
- Cardigan (all  sleev variations etc.)
- unstructured Shacket

# my wardrobe
