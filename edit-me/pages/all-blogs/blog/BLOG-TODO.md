# charity
work out the charity system????
hnaah this is waaayyyy down the line.>.....
add this to the roadmap instead...


----------------

Idea:
- Build on the concept of actually causing change to one's life
    - Sure podcasts can inspire / inform very slowly and loosely...
    - But do they actually inspire change in ones life?
    - Perhaps we could create guides/resources that specifically target that.
        (Like check in things, tick lists... spreadsheets... some type of community encouragement, or accountability buddy scheme...
        maybe discussions of ideas / concepts... to get people involved and always on their mind....
