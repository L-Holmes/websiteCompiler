                <li> Depends on whether you're working for someone else or yourself! </li>
                <li> Often for someone else you feel more trapped, so there is more importance in having a seperate place and not spoiling things that you want to use / see outside of work. Don't over emphasise it though. Still have basic things like plants... It'll be moreso the location and device you associate with work... </li>
