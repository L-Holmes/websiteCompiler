- Chairs are needed for regular people. 
- Socialising is incredibly important; even with people who don't confirm to the suckless mindset


Produciviy is more important. 
You will likely add additional stress and thus negativity into your life by forcing to not use chairs
- I need a chair and desk to concentrate fully.

# Realities of the difficulties of seating
- There are conflicting factors:
    - wanting cheapness
    - wanting natural materials
    - wanting to fit the 'natural way' (i.e. no seat at all)
    --> especialyl having grown up sitting the non-natural way and having no flexibility
    --> But then also out 2 handed typing, eating etc. makes the natural way not really possible...
    - Also if something isn't naturally comfortable it takes almost too much dedication to stick with it... most will naturally just end up in the most convenient / comfortable place.
        - Or if somethign is 'good for you' but not comfortable the stress/cost/other things mentioned above etc. of trying to use it may outweigh any benefits
