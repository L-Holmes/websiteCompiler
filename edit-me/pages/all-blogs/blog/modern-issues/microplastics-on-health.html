# Estimations, based on current data / obersations:
- Microplastic consumption will only go on to increase relateive to previous generations, since they literally don't exit the system.

# Actions:
- Since we know they are harmful, but don't know to what extent (or how much a certain amount of microplastics affects things)
- ... I think it only makes sense to treat with big caution.
- Anything that crosses a barrier that is meant to stop anything from getting in... and doesn't break down... is a big red flag to me...


# Questions:

Emergening research (2025 or later) say on microplastics affect on the health, and particularly from like sofas and other polyester things in the house? 

With abrasion of sitting on them and what not? 
and maybe like wallpaper etc... 

and how basic air purifiers affect this? 

I just don't know if the money spent on new sofas etc. is worth it, health wise or not... 

and I need to know the affect on health to be able to evaluate...
e.g. they emit 20,000 particles per year, 76% of which you'll consume, even  with air purifier running once a week, which will result in 1% more likely memory loss by 75, moving up to 8% after cumulative year consideration in your lifetime

- Does poly clothes rubbing on your skin can microplastics to enter your body?? 
    - even if not... the rubbed particules will be entering your mouth!

----

How effective are air purifiers really?
can I get away with plastic everything with them???


realistically not... just common sense that the plastic will go in your lungs before the machine... 

-----

But does a blanket trap stuff or does it increase surface rubbing and then particles are that small they get past???

really is a standard air filter 99% effective??!??! Even if I like put a poly blanket over me???

# other random
- Air purifier can't stop things you are wearing that are right next to your face from rubbing microplastics into your mouth....
