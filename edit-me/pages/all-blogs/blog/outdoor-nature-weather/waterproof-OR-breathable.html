Goretex is waterproof OR breathable.
It breaths when it's dry but not when it's wet 

(Need a pressure differential) + (not wet surface)

So, 
if it is raining, non-breathable poncho is better
If it is not raining, non waterproof is better.

Rain jackets are only good for when: 
- You will be moving in multiple precipitation events (raining and not raining), in one continuous go 
- AND it is windy when it is not raining 
- AND the humidity is less than 98% when it is not raining 
--> bruh, even then a poncho would be better 

I guess if you lived in a  low humidity place and liked keeping your upper back / shoulders 1% less moist??? 
(Because flapping the poncho will do a lot more) 
Or if style was a big issue...
