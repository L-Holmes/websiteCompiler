# What makes someone clever?

/ What we look for in our team

- They are able to identify what baseline life goals are most important to them,
    - and not be clouded by others things. Especially other things that don't directly relate to that goal
        - e.g. classic example is money not equal to happiness
- They care about getting better, and achieving their ultimate goals to the highest degree
- They are able to prioritise the most important things
- They achieve aims to the highest possible degree
    - When they have a goal, that could involve thinking, they can strategize to achieve it to the maximum of their abilities
        - Excluding outside factors and interference
    - They are able to take all possible related things and learn from them
    - They are able to identify non-obvious links to things (e.g. other sports and swing technique)
- Not ignorant
    - Completely open to new ideas 
    - When presented with new information that affects their current beliefs, they will take it on
- Not driven by emotions in most thinking cicumstances
- They don't get stuck in a certain thought, which would limit them from best meeting their goals
- Take a logical approach to life
- Someone who arrives at the truth
    - e.g. Believing the earth is flat is not a 'truth' because with our current knowledge, the most probable thing, with the most evidence is that the earth is round.
- They have the truth
    - e.g. About how death is not a bad thing...


# How can a clever person help you?
- If you have a problem, and want to make a plan on how to achieve it
- If you want to know what to prioritise in your life, and how to achieve that

# What it is not 
- IQ (pattern recognition) test.
    - With two people of equal 'intelligence', with one having a higher IQ than the other, the one with the higher IQ may achieve things faster, and in some cases, identify something that the lower IQ missed.
        - But most of the time, they are relivitely equal
    - It is possible that you need a certain baseline IQ, but we believe that the baseline is less than average..
- Someone who always achieves highly
    - May be limited by their pattern recognition / memory
    - May be limited by other factors (e.g. anxiety / lack of confidence / motor skills / people skills )
    - May be limited by position
        - May be in a bad position due to:
            - outside influences (country, upbringing, family, friends)
            - previous choices they made before they became clever
- Someone who achieves happiness
    - Everyone has different potentials for happiness
    - People with poor happniess related genes would have no chance at reaching happiness
    - People in bad situations can't reach hapiness
    - You need luck. Luck is everything. 
- A nice person
    - There is no reason why you can't be a pshycopath and be intelligent (very bad combination!)
    - Or perhaps we should ban people who don't have the right morals / beliefs? (e.g. that death is really bad but other worse things aren't...)
- people who don't have the natural drive to research / be inquisitive / learn about stuff
    - unfortunately you can't make the best decision if you are unable to gather all of the facts in the first place
- A person who doesn't have good final aims
    - e.g. Basically people who don't have minimising sadness as the final goal.
    - They may:
        - Have an optimal 'linux' setup
        - Have found the best camera with the aim of something affordable that takes HD video in the right colour etc.
    - But they are mistaking those things for providing happiness, when other choices would lead to greater happiness
- Be perfect / clever all the time in all scenarios 
    - You can't expect everyone to make the best decisions all the time
        - there will be emotional times
        - there will be stuff they're just not interested in
        - there will be moments they take the easiest option / won't think
        - there will be moments when the best choice is really not clear cut
        - there will be moments where they don't have the full picture / limited data to work with
        - convusing moments
            - e.g. software dev, asked best framework to use
                - Make the team happy?
                - Fill out my resume?
                - Pick one I like?
                - What actually is the best, for the goal they are alluding to (I.e. answer the actual question! arguably the moral? thing to do?!)
                - etc.

True genius:

Achieve the best possible result in any task that could possibly include intelligence* (shaq would be amazing at basketball regardless...) (not just hard work...)
identifies their true life goals and uses intelligence to achieve that
Actually puts there mind to things
there are no areas in which their are exceptions (life decisions, in their job, day to day, politically, emotionally)
