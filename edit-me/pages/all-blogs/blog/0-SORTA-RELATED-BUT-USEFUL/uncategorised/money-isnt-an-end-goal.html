    Money isn't an end goal.

    Its like saying that the end goal of a hungry person sewing their crops is to get crops
    It isn't.
    Their real goal is to cure their hunger.
    Crops are a means to a solution.

    Money is the same.
    Money can be used to sometimes buy away unhappiness. That is all.

    Not realising this clouds people's judgement.
    They sacrifice hapiness for the very thing they thought would lead to it.
