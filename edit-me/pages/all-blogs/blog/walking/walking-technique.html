            <h3> Intro </h3>
            this is how I walk.. but you probably don't... But monkeys do, and some tribes.. so what makes this walk better?


            <h3> Other benefits </h3>
            <ul> <li> Less tripping </li>

            </ul>




            <h3> Other thought provoking statements </h3>

            You may walk on your heel naturally but: 
            - how much of that is you copying?
            - walking on soft floors?
            - always wearing shoes?
            - subconsciously fitting in? 


            don't usually mention tribes as I don't think their habits are indicative of 'perfect technique' (they just do what they can to live... Also, you'd think that us in the 'western' world would be the ones to study and yet we have even more issues!)
            But out of interest; Short stride length tribes


            Books main arguments / basis: 
- Most people don't have perfect posture
- Almost no-one walks with a forefoot strike pattern
- Most people have leg length discrepancies
- Most people don't have a minimally impactful walk
