# Listening


## By logic
- Less birds in areas:
    - Without trees
    - Conifers
    - Very urban
    - Even sometimes older forests... which don't have a lot of variety or new growing things...
    - commercial woods
    - Low diversity
        - low food etc.
        - less variety of birds that can live there..

- Birds tend to go to:
    - More deciduous
    - Lots of food (worms, nuts, seeds, fruits, insects)
    - Nesting pitches 
        - Plenty of twigs
        - Trees that will support
        - (probs not too windy, unless they are a gliding bird)
    - plant diversity?
    - sunlight?
    - Fresh water??!?!??
        - Drink
        - Bath
        - Attracts insecs
        - Good for food / shows irrigation for local plants as well.
    - Edge effect?
        - Birds live at the edge of a wood / between wetland and scrub / meadow and hedgerow etc.

Thus;
- Young woodland
- Hedgerows / brambles / bushes
- Wetlands w/ reeds + scrub


# Experiments I want to do:
- (since this is not a very well explored topic!)
- Get a sorted list of most to least bird songs.
    - e.g. Average annual  
    - e.g. Most consistent year round
    - e.g. Best for a particular time of year
    - e.g. Best for certain bird sounds...
    - e.g. Best which also has good walking / hiking around it... That isn't too intense...
