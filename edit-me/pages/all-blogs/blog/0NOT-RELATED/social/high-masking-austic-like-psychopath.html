Because of there [autism], they've learned fake there way through conversations.

Psychopaths are:
- unusually charming
- use emotionally charged words
- may even be extra ordinarily nice to people

Because they've learn that those people attract others.

They have to do that because they don't feel anything or know how to react.

they do that because they also have less natural way to react.

People find me endearing  
they speak slower and deeper to people, (subconsciously!), especially people they'm interested in.  
Technically they'm masking.  
Sometimes they'll forget to go up in pitch at the end of a question they've asked, and try to remember it for next time...

Authority makes me feel good and gives me more confidence. they want to be in charge of people.

* * *

they lie without hesitation.  
To make something sound better.  
E.g. they helped someone in a car breakdown [recently]  
--> saying 3 months ago would expose that they wanted to use that line to make thereself seem nicer to others.
