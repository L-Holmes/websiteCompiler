# masculinity to me
(especially despite possible shortcomings)

#1 Stepping up when needed.
- You're nervous in foreign country but partner is panic and overwhelmed? you overcome that and get to safety
- You're afraid of dogs but see scary one coming towards partner? You stand in front and protect.
- You're week and can't fight but someone is harassing your sister? You try your best to stand up for them.
- You're sister is being shouted at by a relative and has nowhere to stay? You drive for 4 hours in the night to get her.
- carrying a wounded friend or family and giving them you're jacket whilst you do so. Even if you're week and cold and hungry. even if you want to give up. 

# is true femininity and masculinity the same? 
- like if a mother looks after her child. almost like masculine energy but that's peak mum.

# when have I felt masculine?
- At badminton; confident in my skills, I'm in charge (gets respect etc), people come to me for help, don't feel anyone is judging or any idiots or anyone above me.
- When I'm charming a woman who is nice who seems into me. (especially if I can do so with masculine things alike deep voice etc). 
- When I get an opportunity to help (driving back to pick Dana up when she's upset)
- When I ran back to ex girlfriend to apologise.... (i.e. when I'm absolutely driven and thinking about someone else and pushing my body and mind without even thinking to make things better for them)
- when I can show off my body I guess.. at least to a degree...
- When I can stand in front / put an arm in front to make whoever I'm with feel safe from [a dog] etc.
- when I can go back to help someone (e.g. flat tyre...) .. especially if woman...
- when I can lead in some way (e.g. navigating on a trip / re routing / handling changes in plans or routes...)
- Comforting a woman in bed when she is lead on my chest- either tired or after helping reassure her... or even just hugging someone in that way.
