closing the gap...
Just like all this interview advice...

You can't stand out anymore...

same thing with anything... even like making holidays... flirting etc.
there is more knowledge going round...




The very thing that makes AI good the thing makes me worry 
- talented people can't stand out... 
    - low effort, low talent people, spam everything's clouding it all, reducing your ability to find good content. 
    - The brainless people tend to want the most brainless clickbait controversial stuff...) 

+--> (reference the video of the writer saying they have no money... Then say 'im glad that some basic roles are being taken, but like how capitalism in the modern day has just made crappy Chinese gimmicks cheaper, and actual useful things like houses and health car more expensive... I fear ai may do the same)
