Make vids aimed at content creators / people with a big audience!!!  
Then Collab / ask for shout outs...  
(Helping them // or stuff about YouTubers // or stuff about 'youtube bad' // stuff about video making...)  
E.g. analyzing why certain ones failed...  
--> mention the 'doomed idea' strat (not helpful to life...

Other;

- [ ] reacting to them
- [ ] analyzing / critiquing / highlighting good points of their content
- [x] was wrong about [y]  
    "[Creator] just launched a coffee brand. Here's a brand strategist's 5-point analysis of why it will (or won't) succeed.
- [ ] if you like 'x', you'll love 'y'

E.g.  
Analyzing Viktor axelsen step by step  
Analyzing ronaldos movement...

- just big companies. The Genius (and Deception) Behind IKEA's Store Layout." "How Nike's 'Just Do It' Campaign Changed Marketing Forever." "Why a Brand like Rolex Can Charge So Much: A Deep Dive into Perceived Value
    
- possibly people lost in the past for current viewers. E.g. [that hot male actor from the 60s...]

--------------------------------------------------------

What genre of YouTube gets the highest average views count???

What genre best for sponsors???

Best 'effort to consistent (respected) viewership' ratio areas

Best areas to get new people

Best areas were most creators are not clever, so should be easy to use logic and well put together structured videos to dominate

-------------

Youtuber wins  
(Praise YouTubers, copying their style!?!?!?!?)

--------------------------------------------------------

# Get loads of views 
- Look at the trending games.
    - use my knowledge of thumbnails etc. and titles etc.
    - break down something insightful (e.g. minecrafts basic but perfect design)
        - or again, go against the status-quo.

--------------------------------------------------------
Recommend the opposite of what everyone else is recommending

AI won't kill us... It will be beneficial...

You shouldn't quit drinking

You shouldn't quit your smartphone / social media...


i.e. Repeat theme vids:
- opposite of what everyone is recommending (currently and just in general like exercise and veg etc.) 
- bad things to avoid (bad shoes etc.) 
- what to look out for when buying ... (Shoes)
