            <h3> Things that relate to every page </h3>
            <h4> Font choice </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Aims: 1) User Never has a problem reading the text because of an issue with the font choice. 2) User is able to read as fast as possible </li>
                <li> In an ideal world, we wanted a font that is: 1) As easily readable as possible (a. using up the least brain power b. easy to read at the smallest font sizes and least contrast c. )</li>
                <li> What we didn't do: We researched for the scientifically best font. We settled on Atkinson Hyperlegible, despite there being no obious answer. 
                Requirements/considerations that lead to that choice
                - Fonts designed for critical fast read + accurate interpretation presssure scenarios (e.g. Medical fields, driving, transport, etc)
                - Fonts used by countries / organisations generally regarded as intelligent
                    - *Top note: many countries do use fonts that they just trusted one random person to design, and through tradition and cost they have stuck with that. However, like keyboard layouts (dvorak etc), these may be better than default, but likely not optimimal)
                    - *Some of these fonts, e.g. the America one, have other considerations which are not relevant on a website (e.g. Glare at night, cost of letters, etc.)... 
                - Fonts used by organisations generally regarded as intelligent, who also generally have the budget and want to perform their own independent research (i.e. mostly big tech companies)
                    - e.g. microsoft did some studies, and also probs google etc?
                - Fonts specifically designed with hyperlegibility in mind.
                </li>
                <li> We didn't chose becaues we realised it had the negative of: 1) Taking additional time and resources to load the font 2) Taking up code space... Whilst providing no significant benefit to the reader (+ some of the more legible fonts don't look as nice). They are also (3) Potentially not optimised (4) We don't want to spend our time on this. </li>
                <li> But: 1) We hypothesize that the familiarity of a font would also help a user read (i.e. a font they see more often; their brain would get used to it). 2) Most browser/OS fonts are already 99% of the way their for most people. We don't waste time on insignificant optimisation when time can be spent elsewhere 3) There are benefits to not having a font: Less content to load = less bandwidth and faster load speed. 4) Using the default font theoretically allows the user to customise the font to their liking, rather than using what we choose.</li>
                <li> Could the user with dyslexia change their system font? Sure but: 1) We want to be accessible anywhere. e.g. a public libary.. 2) Changing the system/browser font to a dyslexia font may not be possible/too difficult for some users 3) We don't want to waste the user's time doing anything, not even changing a font. 4) We want to introduce users to these features which may make their life better.</li>
            </ul>


			<h3> Text colours <h3>
			<h4> Headings <h4>
			Primary aims:
			- Big contrast against the dark background
			- Not too 'glaring' / 'bleeding' into the background (like a bright white would)...

			Also, for the other two colours:
			I'm trying to find two colours to contrast against off-black / very dark grey
				My aims:
				* Most contrast as possible without being too bright (still want 'off' colours)
				* Clearly not off-white (my main colour)
				* Clearly distinguished, but not clashing (e.g. not red and green which clash...)
				* Easily recognisable as different by colour blind people 
				* Clearly distinct from each other...
			NOT:
				Darker in colour / stylistic. Any of those changes are insignificant...

            # landing page
                - Minimal
                - Fast loading 
                - little to no js
                - initial view is impressive to new users
                - allows users to quickly navigate to other pages. 
                --> things that are higher priority / more people visit should be fastest to get to (assume most users using mouse or a touch screen, and have redirected from Google or their bookmarks) 
                - Gives an overview of the website for new users. 

                # Blog
                - filtering system allowing users to select different blog pages 

                ## Blog page 
                - YouTube video of present

                # products 

                # timeline aims

                # business transparency

                # contact  





                ==============================

                Like zellij.

                Saying realistic aims and then perhaps long term aims. 




                Want to also be the model of a perfect company.

                Have a page that shows the salaries of all workers.
                Split mine up into multiple parts time roles. 


                Make a big deal about how we're trying to grow without backing???

                # Future:
                - Open metricas
                    - Website traffic (e.g., via a privacy-focused analytics tool like Fathom or Plausible), server uptime, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), total customers, maybe even your carbon footprint for hosting.
                - Mailing list / subscription archive


                # Other inspo
                Stripe's Public Documentation: Incredibly clear, comprehensive, and with a changelog. It's a masterclass in technical communication. Inspiration: Treat your "Life Guides" and product specs with the same clarity and detail as API docs.

                Patagonia's "Don't Buy This Jacket" Campaign: Famous for advocating against mindless consumption. Inspiration: The "Anti-Marketing" idea above. Your brand can be about helping people buy less, but better.

                Framework Laptop's Interactive Marketplace: They show you every component, let you customize it, and importantly, show you how to repair it. Inspiration: Extreme product transparency, modularity, and empowering the user with repair guides.

                LessWrong / Astral Codex Ten: The commenting systems often have a higher standard than typical blogs. Inspiration: Enforce a high-quality discourse. Consider a "Why was this comment downvoted?" feature that reveals the top reason (e.g., "Ad Hominem," "Anecdotal," "Unclear").

                Muji's "No-Brand" Aesthetic: Their philosophy is about the product itself, not the logo. The design is purely functional. Inspiration: Let your website design and product design be completely subservient to function. Remove every unnecessary element.

                The "Boring Technology" Principle: The idea is to use the most boring, proven, reliable technology available. Inspiration: Your website's tech stack should be rock-solid and fast, not flashy. You could even write a "Our Tech Stack" page explaining your boring, rational choices (e.g., "We use vanilla JS instead of React because our site is mostly static and it's faster").

                Wikipedia's "Talk" and "View History" Pages: The entire process of knowledge formation is visible. Inspiration: The "Changelog" and "Public Bug Tracker" ideas make your content's evolution transparent, just like a Wikipedia article's.

                # product review pages;
                - A timeline for the product showing: date of purchase, initial review score, notes from 6 months of use, notes from 1 year, any repairs needed, availability of spare parts, and a final "obsolescence score" based on whether the company still supports it.
                - confidence intervals (how confident we are)

                # goals -> don't push people away / functional things I inherintly want in other people's websites
                - familiar design
                - easy to navigate
                - easy to understand 
                - easy to quickly find what you are after

                # goals -> me
                - easy to debug
                - easy to maintain

                -------------
                 - Centrality bias (put things in centre will get picked more) 
                - optical illusions 
                - always use curves (like temple of athena)
                --> curve of beauty?!?


                ------
                Story I more important than product.. (for luxury) 

                Build experience. E.g. showing progress updates etc. 

                -------
                Things I want people to click on (e.g. 'add to basket' / 'pay now' / 'share' etc.)
                - Should make them as;
                    - Novel, whilst still kind of familiar
                    - Big 
                    - Eye catching (graphics, glowing border, etc)

                - Reward them when they buy
                (e.g. confetti, celebration image, gift card / referal (20 for you, 40 for them), etc. )


                encourage people to go through the pages as fast as possible

                -------
                people should _want_ to sign up with others.

                *all you have to do is just get a friend to sign up. *

                High-contrast! buttons

                Action oriented clear, specific labels ('get started' > 'submit')
                Personalisation ('Claim _my_ free reward')

                Placement:
                - User's eyes scan in an 'F' shape; top, left side, and lastly middle.
                    - put important stuff on top and left sidebar!
                 
                Address fears before the user thinks of themn 'you're a new company?' 'what if your products don't work, there are no testimonials?'
                    -> 'well with amazon, you've come to expect everything to be dodgy and potentialy fraudful or just bad...'

                progress indicators for multi-step things, auto fill, minimal form fields, etc. (pay with google pay...)
                security badges next to cart? reviews?

                Help people choose (don't want decision paralysis)
