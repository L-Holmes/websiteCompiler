            <h4> Font choice </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Aims: 1) User Never has a problem reading the text because of an issue with the font choice. 2) User is able to read as fast as possible </li>
                <li> In an ideal world, we wanted a font that is: 1) As easily readable as possible (a. using up the least brain power b. easy to read at the smallest font sizes and least contrast c. )</li>
                <li> What we didn't do: We researched for the scientifically best font. We settled on Atkinson Hyperlegible, despite there being no obious answer. 
                Requirements/considerations that lead to that choice
                - Fonts designed for critical fast read + accurate interpretation presssure scenarios (e.g. Medical fields, driving, transport, etc)
                - Fonts used by countries / organisations generally regarded as intelligent
                    - *Top note: many countries do use fonts that they just trusted one random person to design, and through tradition and cost they have stuck with that. However, like keyboard layouts (dvorak etc), these may be better than default, but likely not optimimal)
                    - *Some of these fonts, e.g. the America one, have other considerations which are not relevant on a website (e.g. Glare at night, cost of letters, etc.)... 
                - Fonts used by organisations generally regarded as intelligent, who also generally have the budget and want to perform their own independent research (i.e. mostly big tech companies)
                    - e.g. microsoft did some studies, and also probs google etc?
                - Fonts specifically designed with hyperlegibility in mind.
                </li>
                <li> We didn't chose becaues we realised it had the negative of: 1) Taking additional time and resources to load the font 2) Taking up code space... Whilst providing no significant benefit to the reader (+ some of the more legible fonts don't look as nice). They are also (3) Potentially not optimised (4) We don't want to spend our time on this. </li>
                <li> But: 1) We hypothesize that the familiarity of a font would also help a user read (i.e. a font they see more often; their brain would get used to it). 2) Most browser/OS fonts are already 99% of the way their for most people. We don't waste time on insignificant optimisation when time can be spent elsewhere 3) There are benefits to not having a font: Less content to load = less bandwidth and faster load speed. 4) Using the default font theoretically allows the user to customise the font to their liking, rather than using what we choose.</li>
                <li> Could the user with dyslexia change their system font? Sure but: 1) We want to be accessible anywhere. e.g. a public libary.. 2) Changing the system/browser font to a dyslexia font may not be possible/too difficult for some users 3) We don't want to waste the user's time doing anything, not even changing a font. 4) We want to introduce users to these features which may make their life better.</li>
            </ul>


			<h3> Text colours <h3>
			<h4> Headings <h4>
			Primary aims:
			- Big contrast against the dark background
			- Not too 'glaring' / 'bleeding' into the background (like a bright white would)...

			Also, for the other two colours:
			I'm trying to find two colours to contrast against off-black / very dark grey
				My aims:
				* Most contrast as possible without being too bright (still want 'off' colours)
				* Clearly not off-white (my main colour)
				* Clearly distinguished, but not clashing (e.g. not red and green which clash...)
				* Easily recognisable as different by colour blind people 
				* Clearly distinct from each other...
			NOT:
				Darker in colour / stylistic. Any of those changes are insignificant...
