- I'm done with selling on eBay / Vinted...
    - Charity all the way...
    - Or just even giving stuff away.

(annoyance of packaging, no one buys stuff, etc) 

Its like the many rich tech people say...
If something is cheap and easy.. don't waste your own time on it.

I don't get enjoyment 
Ordering packages, packing stuff up, listing stuff, dealing with offeres and potential complaints...
Is it worth $5? $50?
having to undersell things... (like my jordans)
