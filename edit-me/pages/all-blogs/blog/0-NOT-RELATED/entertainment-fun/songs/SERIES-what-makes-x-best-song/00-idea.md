(Vid img card could show 'whej I'm gone' and [the Kanye song] 
 and say 'what links all these three and makes them timeless greats  
(Then hint at the emotion and storytelling, or 'its not the beat')



- the beat is great, with great variation in speed tempo who's singing
- it rhymes. Lyrics change, but only ever so slightly,. From I don't wanna be
- --> it like the 'suicide', 'so excited' in kanye's song
- the song changes and uses the most amazing crescendo almost with the 'i don't wanna die' like someone is lifted into heaven. Such emotional resonance.
- the listener can genuinely learn from it.
- not only do these features make the song memorable and enjoyable, but also it helps people...

Similar to when Im gone by eminem- telling an emotional story with climax and resolution

What we can learn / be inspired:

- think of the song like a short story.
- ideally about someone learning something / changing, with deep emotional resonance
