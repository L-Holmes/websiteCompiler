7) Restart and spam f12

8) assuming it opens in boot menu:
You'll likely see around 3 options.

Top one probably windows
I also had network as an option

Look for the option that is likely your usb. It may be the name of the usb brand (e.g. SanDisk) or a name you have given it. 

Use the arrow keys to navigate to that.
Press enter.

Enter a username (e.g. John)  (e.g. main) .
Enter a good user password

Select your device (to note, mine said Samsung because my thinkcentre had a Samsung SSD!) just make sure you don't choose the removable usb.
