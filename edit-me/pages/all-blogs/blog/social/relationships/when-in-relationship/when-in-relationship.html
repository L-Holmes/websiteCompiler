            <h3>Planning activities</h3>

            <h4>Planning dates / days out</h4>
            <div>When possible, base off;</div>
            <ul>
                <li>ideas you've both had together (we should have a curry night some time! ;; We should go round that lake!)</li>
                <li>her stated preferences</li>
                <li>her implied preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Date ideas</h5>

            <h4>Plan nights in (beyond just regular tv/scrolling...)</h4>

            <h2>Things that will help her long-term minimising negativity / health in general</h2>
            <div>(Without like 'forcing' her to the gym or eat better which will not really be possible. She needs to make that choice for herself. You can only influence by saying what you do and she can choose to join you...)</div>

            <h3>Plan to increase close strong frequent social bonds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(since this decreases pain and increases long term happiness!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Better job?</h3>
            - Not just for money
                - It must not negatively affect your day to day life with family.
                - do you need that money?
                - applying etc. could take a lot of time away from her / other things you could be doing.
                - will it increase daily stress in short term? long term?

            <h3>Decreasing your own stressors / negatives (particularly ones that affect her big)</h3>

            <h2>Help</h2>

            <h3>Help her family / close friends</h3>
            <div>(this has the bonus of increasing your close social bonds)</div>

                        </li>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <h2>--> If at her house / have access to house</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Any big house tasks need doing? (e.g. putting up shower door)?

                </li>
                <li>Any general house work need doing? (e.g. washing up, hoovering, cleaning; particularly one's she doesn't like doing / may feel personal pressure to do)</li>
            </ul>

            <div>----------------------------------</div>
            <h2>Things you generally do once (checklist)</h2>
            <h2>Things you continuously do (order of priority)</h2>
            Overview:
            - Help with her direct stressors
            - Prepare to make the future you do have together as good as possible
            - Work on your own stressors
            - Become your best self for her

            Specific guide:
            - Solve her stressors how she would want you to solve them.
                -> Look at your list of her stressors. Regardless of how big or minor, is there anything more you can do?
            - Help her out in the way that she wants helping out.
                - What would she most want? Not what I think she wants... Not what is logically best... Not even what would get the biggest reaction from her... What deep down would she truly most want me to do with this time, out of the options relating to her that I want to do.
            - Work on your appearance
            ....


            <h2>Things you do when they come up </h2>
            <div>----------------------------------</div>

            <h1>Common mistakes</h1>

            <h2>==> Buying things</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Clothes she doesn't want (especially if you already have nice clothes
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you ask her for advice / what to wear that is better. Or look at what she wears and think of a male equivalent (e.g. if she wears trendy things... maybe you should..) (If she wears dickies pants... *maybe* she'd like you in like workwear pants...)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Different fragances (MAYBE just one she likes, if she is into frangrances...)</li>
                <li>ANything you haven't discussed!</li>
                <li>(with all of these a date out together usually better.. DONT WASTE MONEY)</li>
            </ul>
            - Making something for her if you feel like putting a lot of effort into it.
            - Spending time away from her doing things for her when you could be with her
            - Doing what you feel is right rather than just asking what she wants.
                - particularly: should i make this? should i work on my career? should i work extra? or just be here?
            - Not identifying her stressors and doing something about them...
