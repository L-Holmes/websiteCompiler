- Don't message every day
- Message with intention (ideally not just 'hows your day going', but rather 'how did that thing go' or 'lets plan this, what do you think?'
- --> Responding to a message
- --> Have something important that can't be discussed in person / would be awkward / less effective to
- --> To share something relevant (e.g. a cool picture of something she said she likes / link to a joke) 
- Try and save kindness for in-person.
- Keep messages as short as possible.
- Minimal emojis; just match previous tone.
- Don't be overly cautious after the first few messages (if that's alright) (no pressure otherwise)
- light, non-sexual filtering where appropriate;
- “you crack me up 😄”
“you really are trouble aren’t you 😂”
“I liked seeing you today..."

With plans:
- State the plan confidently and with very short reason / explanation if needed.
- Give soft opt-out if necessary 

Checklist: 



======
Don't plan everything
- "You seemed to be an excellent drinks chooser at wagammas, how about you choose one for me?" (then pretend it's disgusting but then laugh and say it's nice)
- Non-strwssful / logic things were all good options E.g. pick the bowling lane
- 'do you have a preference for seats? No? how about there?' 

Variety in feel in pace
- slow moments and elated moments
- Banter / fun
- Genuine, important discussions (typically later on, or in very intimate moments...)
- soft emotional moment / being open and revealing something

Subtle leadership: 
- (end of date) Hey you said you liked padel right? How about we meet up at the padel place in person, 11am?
- Let's try this one
- I'll grab drinks; what would you like?
- That's a shame.. how about we just grab a warm drink and then talk through alternative plans? (then after tone is better, say 'ooh so spontaneous look at us go!' or 'you handled that well back then'

looking out
- warm enough?
- comfortable at this table?
- Like me to grab you coat whilst you do that? 

looking out + confidence;
- shield her back with your arm in heavy busy places
- Smoothly offer your hand in busy fast moving through croud so don't get lost (or for balance on slippy ground etc.)

micro intimacy / flirting
- e.g. If passing something, hold it so that your hands touch
- Share food, but not too much (be confident to ask if you want to try)
- light and appropriate teasing (only if you're a master and know for certain she won't be offended / it calls back to something.)
- photo together?


End a conversation line before it's finished to create intrigue and mystery
- I wanted to mention .. Ooh look at the time we better get to the cinema!
- Remind me to tell you next time

Contrast;
- laughing - break with one quick sincere "I feel so warm inside when you do that"

ask for small favours 

Small observations;
- Did you see the smile on that person? Just shows how much happiness you bring to others lives
- You're smarter than you realise


Ensure the end is really good! 


Bring supplies; 
- hand warmer
- water bottle
- plasters (lol)
- tissues
- phone charger
- ONLY MENTION WHEN RELEVANT

hint at future;
- next time we should [do curling] I bet you'd be lethal on the ice 

cute note; fold into origami?
