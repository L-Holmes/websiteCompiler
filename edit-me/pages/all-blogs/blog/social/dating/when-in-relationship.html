# Be the best partner
## Obvious 
- Be there in times of negativity
    - crisis of course, but even minor upsets.
    - Sacrifice everything (be sensible) and give 100%
- just help out [some of these you do things without asking]
    (especially if she busy / sleeping / time stressed)
    - Wash up
    - Make her breakfast / food whilst she prepares (but ask first)
    - Make cup of water to drink in morning... 
    - Clean up 
- other random things
    - Bring snacks / hand warmers / fan etc. (helping: Hunger, temp control, etc)

TODO
- need to add some sort of priority order to this...

# When away from your partner
- (and you have lots of energy for your partner / to help them out)
- (because helping others brings you a lot of joy)


## Work on yourself
    ## Increase your knowledge
    (Learn things that will benefit her)
    - How to be better at talking
    - How to be better at messaging 
    - Better at disagreements / conflict resolution
        - Phrasing something that you didn't like
        - Phrasing something that you want them to do
            - e.g. 
        - Phrasing something you're annoyed about
            - e.g. "I can't believe you left the dishes like that!" ==> It would make my day if you could clean the dishes + I'd love it if you could do that everytime, would that be possible?
    (obviously practice the above with others as well)

    ### ==> You being better benefitting her planning
    - Plan for quarterly reviews etc. (like the gottman questions)

    ## personal progression
    - General bodily health;
        - Workout   
            - Long term health muscle (Legs, core)
        - Eat really well
    - Improving appearance;
        - Looking better (building big muscle... e.g. Shoulders, traps, core)
        - Losing weight if need be
        - Optimise styling, hygiene, etc.

## Plan
(Future planning)


## Make lists
- List of her interests / hobbies
    --> List of events / things they may like on days out 
        - e.g. Walking // comedy festival // watching F1 race... // lego land 
    --> Upcoming events she cares about 
        - e.g. the British grand prix // traitors
- General 'about her'
    - Values 
    - Long term hopes
    - Long term goals
- Daily stressors / tasks don't like
    - e.g. Washing up // cooking // tired after late shift...
- Overarching stressors / annoying things
    - e.g. work // long-term illnesses // periods etc. 
- A resource / a decision chart to make making decisions together easier
- List of things that stress you 
- List of things that you do / may happen to you that would affect her
    - e.g. If you have anxiety / bad weight etc. etc.

### Further things you can do with these lists
- Plan things to make for her that actually mean something / will actually help
- Plan / research every possible way to solve/improve the stressors
    - Don't force them upon her!
- Plan what you can do when you're not actively on an activity together in order to help

## Make physical things
- e.g. things to make;  
    - Baking 
    - Food
    - Meal prep
    - Finding new recipies to try 
    - Notes to leave around the house
    - Playlist of new songs based off her likes
    - physical letter
    - Jars with written activity ideas to pull out of.
    - Handwritten letter sent to her address
    - Note to leave in her house
    - Spotify playlist??? 

### Planning activities
#### Planning dates / days out
- When possible, base off;
    - ideas you've both had together (we should have a curry night some time! ;; We should go round that lake!)
    - her stated preferences
    - her implied preferences

##### Date ideas

#### Plan nights in (beyond just regular tv/scrolling...)


## Things that will help her long-term minimising negativity / health in general
(Without like 'forcing' her to the gym or eat better which will not really be possible. She needs to make that choice for herself. You can only influence by saying what you do and she can choose to join you...)

### Plan to increase close strong frequent social bonds
    - (since this decreases pain and increases long term happiness!)

### Better job? 

### Decreasing your own stressors / negatives (particularly ones that affect her big)


## Help

### Help her family / close friends
(this has the bonus of increasing your close social bonds)

### 

---------------------------

# Final decision tree/flowchart
(assuming done all of the pre-prep things..., like the 'about them' list etc.)
- Workout day and not done workout?
    - Workout 
- Got next couple dates planned?
    - Plan *options* for next couple of dates.
        - (still more important to work out what she wants-- don't force the options on her!)
        
    - Evaluate if appropriate to add 'other' addition (secret note, making something, baking something) for next date / meet. If so prep it.

## --> If she's at work specific
- Plan motivational messages to send if she's into that.
 
## --> If she's with family / friends
- Leave her to it.

## --> If at her house / have access to house
- Any big house tasks need doing? (e.g. putting up shower door)?
    - Do that.
- Any general house work need doing? (e.g. washing up, hoovering, cleaning; particularly one's she doesn't like doing / may feel personal pressure to do)


----------------------------------
# Common mistakes
## ==> Buying things
    - Clothes she doesn't want (especially if you already have nice clothes
        - If you ask her for advice / what to wear that is better. Or look at what she wears and think of a male equivalent (e.g. if she wears trendy things... maybe you should..) (If she wears dickies pants... *maybe* she'd like you in like workwear pants...)
    - Different fragances (MAYBE just one she likes, if she is into frangrances...)
    - ANything you haven't discussed!
    - (with all of these a date out together usually better.. DONT WASTE MONEY)
