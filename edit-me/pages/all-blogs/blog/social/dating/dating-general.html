1) Understand what you want.
- e.g. If someone is argumentative, they may also want someone kind of argumentative as crazy as that sounds.
    - Like instead of me saying 'oh sorry, I didn't intend to upset you, in future I'll [not do the thing]"... people end up still heated...
1) b. Know what you require.
    - Some people aren't bothered about overcomplicating relationships.
