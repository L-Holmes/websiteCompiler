    </ul>

    <h3>Ancient Egypt & Near East</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular consumption of emmer wheat, barley, and legumes like lentils and chickpeas for bulk</li>
        <li>Figs and dates eaten as natural laxative fruits</li>
        <li>Fermented milk products like yogurt used to support gut flora</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classical Greece & Rome</h3>

        <li>Olive oil consumed on an empty stomach or with lemon to lubricate the tract</li>
        <li>Natural sulfate spring waters consumed as mineral purgatives</li>
        <li>Morning hydration habits involving large volumes of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medieval & Renaissance Europe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stewed prunes (dried plums) used as a winter staple for their bowel-softening properties</li>
        <li>Pickled vegetables like sauerkraut and their brines used for probiotics</li>
        <li>Licorice root and dandelion greens used as bitter tonics</li>
        <li>Castor oil became a standard remedy for children in later eras</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scandinavia & Eastern Europe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fermented fish sauces and sour milk used for gut motility</li>
        <li>Kefir and other fermented milk drinks used to replenish flora</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General Lifestyle & Manual Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Squatting position used universally before the invention of the seated toilet to align the rectum</li>

        <li>Timed morning rituals established to align with the gastrocolic reflex</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary of Mechanisms & Biological Similarities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>FODMAPs (Polyols/Sorbitol): Multiple cultures (Europe, Asia, Middle East) utilized high-sorbitol fruits like prunes, apricots, peaches, and plums, which draw water into the bowel via osmosis</li>
        <li>FODMAPs (Lactose): The use of warm milk (India) or fermented milk (Global) utilizes lactose and fats to stimulate movement, which acts as a mild laxative for those with lower lactase levels</li>
        <li>Anthraquinone Stimulants: A distinct chemical similarity exists between African Senna, Chinese Rhubarb, and American Cascara/Aloe; distinct cultures independently discovered plants containing anthraquinones which irritate the colon lining to trigger contraction</li>
        <li>Mucilage and Soluble Fiber: African Okra, American Aloe, and Indian Psyllium all utilize gelatinous plant substances to create a slippery gel that eases passage</li>
        <li>Lubrication: A universal strategy of ingesting pure fats (Olive oil in Mediterranean, Ghee in India, Castor oil in Europe) to physically grease the intestinal walls</li>
    </ul>
