- I feel there is no substitute for mobile notes.
- I'm always taking notes
- audio notes:
--> naturally cluttered
--> can't correct things
--> can't name things
--> can add to an existing group
--> I'd have to translate to text anyway

There are no more taking devices. Only smart phones 


======== 

Reality:
- I may be stuck in my ways.
- I need to accept that in my current position...
--> I am going to keep needing car maps
--> I'm going to keep needing notes 
--> I'm going to have all these questions when I'm not near my computer... At times where I want the answer now, so I can continue to think on that... 
--> I'm going to want to listen to podcasts in the car...
--> 


And ultimately...
The time it saves me... Is just worth it... It's sad, but the world is devolving into a smartphone centred place... 


# CURRENT PHONE I NEED IT MOMENTS 
- "what if I need to take notes?"
- "maps" 

Lesser:
- "I'm at barbers / hospital / cafe"
- "I'm lonely and exhausted and am somewhere without computer (e.g. bath)"
