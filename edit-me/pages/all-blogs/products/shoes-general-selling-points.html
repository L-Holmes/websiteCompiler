# concerns / worse case scenario

- My target audience doesn't exist / I cannot reach them
--> No one wants custom sizes
--> people want returns
--> I have to put everything on sale (just like on vinted) to even get people to consider buying

- people say forefoot striking is stupid
- there is no evidence and no one does it
- there are no scientific studies on it.

I never get enough customers to pay back the investments that I have made
