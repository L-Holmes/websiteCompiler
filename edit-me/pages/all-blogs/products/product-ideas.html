# PRODUCT PAGE IDEAS
# ---------------------
- Opotional extras for non-ideal things that people probs want
    - e.g. ortholite insoles
    - e.g. extra padding...


- Pricing strat:
    3 tier
    (since people are comparitive thinkers?)
        - one really high option, your true price as the left item, and then a slightly more premium item that makes us loads of profit in the middle!!?!?


## ENCOURAGE BUYING


### Rule 1) partitioning / foot in the door / complete the set..

- split price into multiple smaller buys, ideally separated / done at seperate times...
- --> e.g. £5 per month (Vs 60 per year..)
- --> e.g. £10 for camera (vs. 30 with accessories)

### Rule 2) anchoring + addons

- show a lower initial base price

### rule 3) up selling

- show other linked options at checkout (quick add)
- --> e.g. like McDonald's

### rule 4) charm pricing

- 9.99 rule..

### rule 5) the third option

- add the desired option as the middle option

### rule 5.5 for just 50p extra

- gap between medium and large is small

### rule 6) free shipping

- give an extra perk when user crosses a barrier
- --> e.g. free shipping at £50
- --> e.g. free socks at £20

### rule 7) subtle fomo

- e.g. only 500
- e.g. 300 remaining, 209 remaining ... (Make it go down every second even if not selling things...)

### rule 8) bundling

- makes people buy more, for the deal
- again makes them think they're in control...
- --> e.g. McDonald's meal deal

### rule 9) gameify and reward more purchasing

- e.g. shout-outs
- e.g. on screen celebration graphics / prestige graphics
- e.g. hand written letters etc.

### caveats

- with additional shipping costs, it's mainly the suprise of big international fees. If you give an estimate asap, people are alright with it.
- all inclusive only works for holidays...
