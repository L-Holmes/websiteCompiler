# winter, no rain

- tight mesh tee if not going down to base (e.g. not going inside really hot room)  https://www.brynje.no/eu/en/t-shirt-lightweight   ???
Wool/cotton blend?
Silk (underneath cotton)?
Linen? (loose fit)
Cotton net (underneath cotton)??

which would be the best??? 
weight in water: 
omg there aren't any studies???
no drying time studies either!! 

need to test that...
then also the weight...
then also the general comfort of each clothing combo... subjectively... 

wait no, we wouldn't get the mesh or the silk , for the t-shirt at least. As we are prioritising weight, with rh minimum sweatiness that we can deal with (unless the weight of water in the cotton causes it to become heavier...).
So only if those are unbearable (cotton or linen .. maybe bamboo?) would we go to alternatives. 
Maybe silk underpants though???

cotton vest for sports???
slim fit, keeps the sticky sweat off your back
