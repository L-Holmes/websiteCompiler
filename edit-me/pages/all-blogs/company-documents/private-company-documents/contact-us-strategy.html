            <h3> Filter out contacters </h3>

            <ul>
                <li> 1) List of tags user can choose from to tag their contact
                        - Allow user to create / request tag if one is not present? (obvs not rude or swear word...)
                </li>
                    

                <li> 2) Recommended existing FaQs / pages which may be relevant 
                </li>

                <li> 3) Allow the user to send email.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Why is this necessary? </h4>
            - We have very limited time and money
            - Most questions will be about things already covered on the website. We need to try and send people towards them...
            - We can't sacrifice our mental, time and output on the minority. This is a general rule in company running...

            <h3> Ungrouped concerns (TODO sort this section out) </h3>


            - Issues with shoes / refunds?????
            - wrong size?
            - shoe failing due to the user being extra rough??? --> Probs say 1 month warrenty or something like that.
