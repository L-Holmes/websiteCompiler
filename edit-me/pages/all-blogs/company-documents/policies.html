            <h3> # Refund policy </h3>

            <ul>
                <li> 
                    - Can only return within 30 days of purchase
                    - Will not get full refund- we keep £40.
                    - This is to discourage fast fashion buying and returning
                    - Buyer must pay return postage
                    - We then sell those shoes as 'in-stock'

            </ul>
