            <h3> Examples of advertising </h3>
            <h4> Extreme feet (whilst something related to a point I'm trying to make) to prove something </h4>
            e.g. I ran a marathon in my sandals to prove they are the best 

            <ul>
                <li> 
                    * Advert. : Just fake product reviews on Reddit / YouTube
                    * Advert. Cont. : maybe basic product photos / setup on socials to look legitimate
                </li>
                <li> Youtubers for advertising (probs reviewers?) </li>
                <li>competitions / giveaways </li>
                <li>Pop-up shops at busy / target audience areas? </li>
                <li>Monthly competitions for people to submit their ideas? One becomes a reality and they get share of sales? </li>
                <li>Have an 'Awpen day' 1 day a year? (or 1 weekend?) </li>
            </ul>
