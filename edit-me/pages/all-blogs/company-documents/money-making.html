        <h3> Reward systems </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Gift Vouchers </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> When to use these rewards </h4>
        - After the user has made a payment 
        - When the user has things in their cart
        - As part of a promotion prize
        - As part of a competition prize

        <h3> What to research </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Competitors:
            - Pain points of competitor products
            - Why did competitors/people making same product as me fail?
        </li>
        <li> how to find my target audience:
            - How do they find out about new things? Instagram? Youtube? Word of mouth?
        </li>

        <li> Sustainability (grants, publicity etc) </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Things to capitalise on </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Anti-trip shoes for old people </li>
        <li> Sustainability (grants, publicity etc) </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Advertising strat</h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Reddit comments/posts? Creating multiple accounts?!?!? </li>
        <li> Sustainability (grants, publicity etc) </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> keeping people coming back </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> New posts / discussion from the community? because im not going to post continuously...</li>
        <li> New deals? </li>
        <li> [weekly] reviews of what people have sent me messages about? </li>

            I'm thinking;
            1) Comment section type thing on posts / invitation for people to disprove my posts since people like to disprove and it causes drama. 

            2) A public available space for recommending topic ideas and additional 'imptove life's recommendations. 
            Someway to filter out poor ideas andd encourage better ones. 
        </ul>
