- Durability tests (like rose anvil... runrepeat.. etc)
    - Estimated lifespan
    - etc...


# Principles
- Make them realise
    - Don't tell them what to think.
    - Present facts in a way to make them realise
    - No:
        - 'why our product is good' ->
            - negatives of competitors
                - Or even just mention what makes a shoe bad and then subtly highlight those features in competitors
            - what makes a shoe good in general
            - what features our shoe has 
            - what the science says

# {Product Name}
# {how this product benefits you vs. alternatives, summary}
    => Again, don't directly say. 
# {buy now, big // 'Add this product to my collection' / 'I want the benefits from this product!'}
# Reliability / how close this product is to perfection
    - e.g. 88/100

# Purpose / Aims 

# Product stats
- e.g. weight / height etc.

# Fit of the product (on different people)
(some more real-life, non-studio photos)

# Scientific tests
(like runrepeat)
-> What these tests mean.

# Why? (our design choices) 
## every single possible consideration
[price]
[durability]
[appearance]
[possible benefits to your life]
[possible drawbacks to your life]
...
- [chose to keep costs down {1} ]
- [use lightweight materials {2} ]
    - ## Every single possible 
## Every single possible option for each of those considerations
        (as part of a dropdown?)

# How this product may benefit you (more in-depth)
- Tool to calculate the amount of force saved by using this product (for a person of weight 50kg )
    - what this will look like over a lifetime, and compare that to something memorable (e.g. the weight of 50,000 heavy things, like a car or a cow or a person, or a coo)

## random other stats (ensure I don't get sued):
- frame as preventing things 
    - e.g. Prevent getting injured
    - e.g. avoid injury
    - e.g. You spend xxx on new shoes and for knee pain... prevent that.
        -> e.g. a table, comparing the costs of resolving knee issues, buying lots of shoes etc. so they work out for themselves the better option

# Our competitors
- [table comparing our product vs comnpetitors]
- [table comparing our company vs competitors (simple ticks probs)

- proprietary metrics that favour my [shoes]
- e.g. 'sustainability ratio', 'plastic freeness', 'barefooted ness', 'energy absorption amount from calves/foot muscles', 'angle of force increase' 'joint stability' etc.

- lifetime cost calculator?

- [scientific tests of competitors]
     
# What we didn't do / What competitors do bad / why we are better than competitors

# What we may have got wrong / important considerations

# Every other possible approach
## Realistic approaches
- sandals; rigid peaces; heal counters; made in china? etc.

## Unrealistic approaches...
(params for a realistic approach?)

# Comments on sources
    (not the sources themselves- they will be on the sources page)
    (perhaps I group lots of sources? e.g. all that relate to body weight impact)
