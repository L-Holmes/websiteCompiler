# Measures:
- Information density
    - Amount of sentences/words that are directly actionable
    - Percentage Relative the the most dense/concise amount
    - e.g. Us = 100%; Huberman = 30%; chris willx = 1%...
- Num. topics covered
    - e.g. Us = 120; Huberman = 30
- % of topics that are actually relevant to giving people a better life
    - e.g. Us = 100; Huberman = 80, ...
- % of topics which are actionable
    - e.g. Us = 100; Huberman = 40 (still very good!)
- % of things that are not false information
    - e.g. Things like roka glasses...
    - e.g. Things like supplements when you don't have deficiencies
    - e.g. Things like probiotics
    - e.g. Us = 100

- Time taken to find every single life advice strategy
    - Us = 5 mins
    - Huberman = 500 hours...
- Consideration of money in every decision
    - We don't ignore that money is what allows us to buy away sadness
    - We scrutinize every single decision against the predicted amount of negatvity it will take away / result in...
- Consideration of how much each actionable thing will affect your life
    - So you can prioritise and optimise which you do / which approach you take.
- Evaluations/predictions on reliability and safety and accuracy
    - i.e. science is inherently flawed and has been proven to do so many times over the years
    - so many conflicting recommendations... just look at diets. They all seem right. But there is no clear answer.
    - Our evlautation of paleo principles, we beleive (Based of analyusing past things in science that have turned out to be true / false.. and using common sense on whether we would have evolved to do something...)
      that grounding in paleo / etc. allows our recommendations to be as accurate as possible.


(uncategorised)
- ever regretted buying a really expensive supplement or product and not really feeling its essential to your life or that the money could have been better placed?
    - Yep -we don't want that. We optimise against that...


Why we 'lack' (even though they aren't really negatives)
- Digestability for the average person (giving more money for the podcast people)
    - e.g. Us = 20% - We are not optimised for that!
- Stories 
- Person saying it is an 'expert in their field' 
    - e.g. Us = 1%
    - We rely on the findings of experts
    - Although this also means we don't have any 'false' experts
    - We don't beleive anything and assume by default that most science experiments are flawed / missing things.


# What if [huberman lab] covers same topics as you, and creates a guide with just as much?
- (a) It will be hard to reach our 100%...
- (b) We will still be...
    - Hitting more 
    - Covering less things that don't help
    - and ultimately... we believe..
        - lowering your negativity score more...
        - giving you a better life.
