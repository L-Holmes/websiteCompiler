            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5> What benefit? (what makes this website different + proof (not just claims) of usefulness to the readers life) </h5> 
                    <div> Why? We expect our readers to be intelligent; to value their time. Hence they;
                    - Want to determine whether a page is useful / worth reading within a few seconds
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>

                    --> Is it logically organised? Nice headers, bullet points, clearly seperated sections and sentences / paragraphs
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Recommended intro blogs; </h3>
            <div> 
                Now, as a general rule, we cut down our sentences as much as possible, to give you only the information you need. This will be the last ever of these wordy sentences you will read on this _entire website_ (assuming everything goes to plan) 
            </div>

			<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> Writings we're most proud of </h3>

            <h3> What we aim to do / what kind of content you can expect from us </h3>

            - Explore every single thing investigated in science that relates to health and thus happiness
            - Create theories based on ancesteral thoughts/findings
            - preventing common things, like dementia, joint issues etc.

            We will not cover:
            - things that treat specific medical conditions
                --> Not relevant to our wider audience.
                --> Can generally be researched seperately / you can see a specialist hopefully.
            - papers that don't learn anything / aren't relevant
            - unnecessary papers that just aren't helpful / repeat things we already know
            - papers on AI / physics / natural phenomenon / maths proofs / ways of writing better etc.

            <h3> Purpose of website </h3>


            Make our team happy 
                --> Yep, we're not going to hide the truth.
                --> We created ..
                --> But at least we are sticking to our principles...
                --> But luckily we get happy from helping others...
            - Giving me more money
                - New people will stay on the site
                - New people will be inspired to tell others about the site -> use psychological tricks to keep them -> quick information (short attention span), easy digestable info , etc.
            - Giving me satisfaction
                - Repect -> Well organised, logical, science backed-up.
                - Aligning with my goals ->
                - ? -> Reflecting the intelligent theories by having an intelligent design
            - 



            How much emphasis on different goals?
            - 90% money.
            - 10% logic. 
            - This is actual trivial. The content etc will provide the logic. 
            - yeah just make it with money in mind, and everything else will work out. 
                - (the requirements of logic, repspect, satisfaction will keep the money requirement from getting out of hand.)
