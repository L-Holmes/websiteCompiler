                    <div> Why? We expect our readers to be intelligent; to value their time. Hence they;
                    - Want to determine whether a page is useful / worth reading within a few seconds
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>

			<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>

            <h3> Rambling</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> Money is not one of the start-point things, when looking at life as a whole.</li>
                <li>You have:
                    - Your time
                    - What you are doing in that time
                </li>
                With what you are doing in that time... you're either...
                - enjoying the moment
                - building a better future
                
                (or both... or enduring something bad until you get to a stable 'free' point...)

                Building a better future can be done through;
                - money
                - career
                - choicess
                - health, physical and/or mental
                - social
                - planning
                - choices
                - knowledge/research
                - etc.
            </ul>

            <h3> Recommended intro blogs; </h3>
            <div> 
                Now, as a general rule, we cut down our sentences as much as possible, to give you only the information you need. This will be the last ever of these wordy sentences you will read on this _entire website_ (assuming everything goes to plan) 
            </div>


            - Minimising negativity, the concept
            - Decision framework for deciding on a purchase
            - Decision framework deciding what to do...???
            - Ancestral theory.
            - Aim to be productive... or getting your mind in a productive state...
                - No wasted time.
            - Every life rule, ordered and prioritised (including vitimiin D, sleep, and the usual things...)
            - What to buy / buying decision framework

            - How to research
            - Our day in the life
            - Key missing thing for intelligent people? (focusing on minimising sadness?)???? 
            - [what to do, in what order... Just tell me what to do...]?????

            Things we think reflect our company:
            - How we spend your money
            - Our website design
            - (other about life choices / us being smart / etc.)

			<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> Writings we're most proud of / (some more unique writings?) </h3>

            - How to walk
            - Ancestral diet
            - Minimising joint impact
            - Optimal use of time?
            (link to everything else tagged with unique)

            
            <h3> What we aim to do / what kind of content you can expect from us </h3>

            - Explore every single thing investigated in science that relates to health and thus happiness
            - Create theories based on ancesteral thoughts/findings
            - preventing common things, like dementia, joint issues etc.
            - Negativity score
            - Mapping out the biggest causes of negatvity... (joint pain...)

            We will not cover:
            - things that treat specific medical conditions
                --> Not relevant to our wider audience.
                --> Can generally be researched seperately / you can see a specialist hopefully.
            - papers that don't learn anything / aren't relevant
            - unnecessary papers that just aren't helpful / repeat things we already know
            - papers on AI / physics / natural phenomenon / maths proofs / ways of writing better etc.

            <h3> Purpose of website </h3>


            Make our team happy 
                --> Yep, we're not going to hide the truth.
                --> We created ..
                --> But at least we are sticking to our principles...
                --> But luckily we get happy from helping others...
            - Giving me more money
                - New people will stay on the site
                - New people will be inspired to tell others about the site -> use psychological tricks to keep them -> quick information (short attention span), easy digestable info , etc.
            - Giving me satisfaction
                - Repect -> Well organised, logical, science backed-up.
                - Aligning with my goals ->
                - ? -> Reflecting the intelligent theories by having an intelligent design
            - 

            How much emphasis on different goals?
            - 90% money.
            - 10% logic. 
            - This is actual trivial. The content etc will provide the logic. 
            - yeah just make it with money in mind, and everything else will work out. 
                - (the requirements of logic, repspect, satisfaction will keep the money requirement from getting out of hand.)

                <h3> general about us </h3>

                I don't go too extreme;
                - don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...
                - If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. 
                - I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. 
                - I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance
                - I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. 

            <h3> Further categorising </h3>
