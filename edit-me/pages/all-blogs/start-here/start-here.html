            # Summary for the average person:
            ----------------
            Summaries of scientific findings/theories that:
            - Are relevant to your life
            - Which you can take action on / change your life for
            Leading to to a better life


            ----------------
            ----------------
            ----------------
            ----------------
            i.e. 
            Actionable science, relevant to your life. All summarised in one place.
            Actionable theories, grounded in evolutionary theory. All summarised in one place.
            
            What it brings to the world:
            - A way to get life optimisation advice quickly.
                - with accurate/backup material (i.e. referenced scientific papers)
                - No fluff, no wasted.

            Podcasts are great.
                - But that's all we have right now, as far as life advice goes...
                - They are entertaining, but:
                    - Its difficult to go back and 'revise' the learnings
                    - Sometimes they are entertaining, but perhaps no clear actionable things that you can focus on.
                        - Often sometimes can be meaningless inspiration which lasts until your regular life gets back at you
            ----------------

            Idea:
            - Build on the concept of actually causing change to one's life
                - Sure podcasts can inspire / inform very slowly and loosely...
                - But do they actually inspire change in ones life?
                - Perhaps we could create guides/resources that specifically target that.
                    (Like check in things, tick lists... spreadsheets... some type of community encouragement, or accountability buddy scheme...
                    maybe discussions of ideas / concepts... to get people involved and always on their mind....
            ----------------

            <h3>Makes us unique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We believe we are unique in that.. (at the time of writing)
                    <ul>

            <h3> More accurate findings </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We will always update our suggestions based on new findings, and make these changes clear.</li>
                <li>For us to mention something, it muts ideally be grounded in logic, science and evolution theory. Ideally as many of those as possible.</li>
                <li>i.e. scientific drug / diet claims that aren't matching with evolutionary expectations / 'common sense' (for lack of a better phrase) won't necessarily be recommended. 
                    e.g. Not eating eggs... all unsaturated fat bad... take all these probiotics and vitimins and protein...
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3>Examples of how you may have a better life (this should go lower down or be a side note...)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>May avoid a bad relationship</li>
                <li>May have money to afford a life changing operation due to making good financial decisions previously in your life</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3>Us benefiting you side notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A lot of the things we discussed are long term minimal non obvious things. So measuring there success will be very difficult!
                    <ul>
                        <li>e.g. if reducing microplastics consumption by 40% decreases your chance of dementia by 2% over the course of your lifetime... can we measure that?</li>

            <h3>Other ways we may benefit you</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspire you into recognising and accepting what you always knew (the true thing that inspirational / science media people do...)</li>
                <li>Provide you with some entertainment when you aren't doing anything else</li>
                <li>Inspire you down a life path that benefited you greatly</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3>How we may not benefit you</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you already have a very happy life, and will do into the future</li>
                <li>With ehbnature of luck and life, reading our material may send you down a life path that is not optimal. Despite our attempt that it increases the probability that you go down a better life path</li>
                <li>If you fall outside of the people in our target audience, possibly. (you may feel underwhelmed)</li>
                <li>If you are set in your ways (our suggestions may be seen as controversial / not following social norms)</li>
                <li>if you have a relitively restricted life and are not able to change your life in accordance with some of our suggestions (making you feel even more like you're missing out)</li>
                <li>?if you tell our material to more ignorant people who react negatively towards you because of it.. (we are very sorry you are in that situation)?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3>other thoughts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We aim that consuming our material will increase the probability of you taking a life path that is equal to or better than the one you have now (diagram showing the different life paths, and ones with positive outcomes and those with negative outcomes)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3>Not sure where this goes...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>roadmap -- we prioritise strictly; we have a clear action plan for the future (more so why support / stick with us.... more proof of our competence we like to think)</li>
                <li>philosophy (again, we believe this increases our chance of us being trustworthy and maximally beneficial in sl to the reader.. don't have proof why though because the proof is in the pudding...)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> 3 main goals </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>

                        <li>++ Minor things: paleo, fitness?? </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    (3) Fixing failures of the modern lifestyle
                    - vitamin d 
                    - lack of social interaction
                    - micro plastics

            <h3> A few other core beliefs </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most decisions can be grounded in evolution and our ancestor's lives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make contentness easier by lowering your dopamine threshold.

            <div> I don't go too extreme; </div>
            <li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
            <li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
            <li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
            <li> I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. </li>

            <div> *i.e. We prioritise. We aim to only optimise as much as we need to.* </div>
