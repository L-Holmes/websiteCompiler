                <li>Well really, it's up to the reader.. They acknowledge that we are listing loads of advice / ideas that are grounded in science which is either proven, makes sense, or had been proven over the course of a long time.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Each of our writings aims to have some proof to backup claims. Ideally as many of the following as possible;</li>
                <li> Reliable Scientific papers (ideally)</li>
                <li> Evolutionary theory</li>

            # Summary for the average person:
            ----------------
            Summaries of scientific findings/theories that:
            - Are relevant to your life
            - Which you can take action on / change your life for
            Leading to to a better life

            ----------------
            ----------------
            ----------------
            ----------------
            i.e. 
            Actionable science, relevant to your life. All summarised in one place.
            Actionable theories, grounded in evolutionary theory. All summarised in one place.
            
            What it brings to the world:
            - A way to get life optimisation advice quickly.
                - with accurate/backup material (i.e. referenced scientific papers)
                - No fluff, no wasted.

            Podcasts are great.
                - But that's all we have right now, as far as life advice goes...
                - They are entertaining, but:
                    - Its difficult to go back and 'revise' the learnings
                    - Sometimes they are entertaining, but perhaps no clear actionable things that you can focus on.
                        - Often sometimes can be meaningless inspiration which lasts until your regular life gets back at you
            ----------------

            Idea:
            - Build on the concept of actually causing change to one's life
                - Sure podcasts can inspire / inform very slowly and loosely...
                - But do they actually inspire change in ones life?
                - Perhaps we could create guides/resources that specifically target that.
                    (Like check in things, tick lists... spreadsheets... some type of community encouragement, or accountability buddy scheme...
                    maybe discussions of ideas / concepts... to get people involved and always on their mind....

            WHY TRUST US

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> general about us </h3>

            <div> I don't go too extreme; </div>
            <li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
            <li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
            <li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
            <li> I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. </li>

            <div> *i.e. We prioritise. We aim to only optimise as much as we need to.* </div>

            <div> 
                Now, as a general rule, we cut down our sentences as much as possible, to give you only the information you need. This will be the last ever of these wordy sentences you will read on this _entire website_ (assuming everything goes to plan)
