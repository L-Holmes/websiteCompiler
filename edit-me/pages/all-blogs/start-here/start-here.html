                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    (3) Fixing failures of the modern lifestyle
                    - vitamin d

            <h3> A few other core beliefs </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most decisions can be grounded in evolution and our ancestor's lives.

                <li>
                    Make contentness easier by lowering your dopamine threshold.

            <h3> general about us </h3>

            <div> I don't go too extreme; </div>
            <li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
            <li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
            <li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
            <li> I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. </li>
