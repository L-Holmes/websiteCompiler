- Add the info popup on the filters?
    - Or is it too small to even click accurately?
    - MAYBE we just have a key instead???????
    - Could just be a regular blog type page that lists all of the different filter options????
        - Then it has a close button which just redirects back to the same page??
- Make 'see results' button bigger. At least on mobile... 25% wider, 20% taller...
- Some indication to show that filters are active? (making the '...' be selected???)
- Sort options don't fit on page on mobile, you have to scroll laterallly... 



coding TODO:

- Start setting up pages for all my blogs.

other TODO:
- look into market research;
    - usability of limited people
    - how to do user interviews.

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????

# Longer term road map
-> get some feedback from people on the general design.
-> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.

# donation buttons;
'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list???'?
