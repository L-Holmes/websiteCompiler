- Work out what t odo with aeasthetics of filters
    - add more spacing when showing all filters
    - perhaps more lateral space to seperate sort from the intro filters
- need to make the filters themselves seperate, and passed in to the template based on whether blogs or products
- add filters for the 'new here' and 'help' etc. + work out how to do that... seperate pages? 
- work out what to do with the search...
    - just add some basic js, loaded on search, that just searches through all blogs / products???
- Add the donation buttons
    - + consider what else I need... is it just donations?
    - perhaps a contact??
- Clear all filters button
- bug when returning back to home page, it doesn't update the url with correct filters.
    - so it messes up when you then return back to the products/blogs. (+ since blogs and products share things...)
    - just remove the urls when returning back, I reckon.
- Price high-to-low doesn't seem to work (when we have just boot and sapp-boot at least...)

# Longer term road map
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
