- sort button styling broken... again...
- consider centring the sort button
- consider making the blogs page just have big squares in 2 columns... just so it looks good and i can move on with my life.
- 


- Add price to example elements (and date) so i can integrate sort.
- Make sort work per section. (e.g. products; sort blogs)
- create the seperate blogs page

----------------------------------------------------

- work on the blogs
    - get the blogs all importing the global blogs css 

- make search bar clickable from anywhere
- same for other buttons on the home page.
- implement filtering thing where turning off colour doesn't affect
- implement filter saves to URL.
- implement changing language changes the URL to en-...
- Update the landing page on desktop- side buttons should take up the width of the entire page, but then the contents should be padded by loads so that it appears as if the buttons are in a nice legible position.


# Longer term road map
- Get all of the links on the home page going to actual pages
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
