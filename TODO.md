- search results;
    - Sort out the 'close popup' icon for the search results.
- add filters for the 'new here' and 'help' etc. + work out how to do that... seperate pages? 

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...
- Links to podcast / youtube????

# Longer term road map
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.

# donation buttons;
'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list???'?
    --> But for products, name it like the benefits you get "Join our community (We want you!(re intelligence!) "'
