- work out what to do with the search...
    - just add some basic js, loaded on search, that just searches through all blogs / products???
- Add the donation buttons
    - + consider what else I need... is it just donations?
    - perhaps a contact??
- Clear all filters button
- bug when returning back to home page, it doesn't update the url with correct filters.
    - so it messes up when you then return back to the products/blogs. (+ since blogs and products share things...)
    - just remove the urls when returning back, I reckon.
- add filters for the 'new here' and 'help' etc. + work out how to do that... seperate pages? 


# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...
- Links to podcast / youtube????

# Longer term road map
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
