todo coding

- on item, slightly increase spacing between things. just a tiny bit margin perhaps, or xs spacing
- make the clickable on hover thing come on when hovering over items. 
- make the filter thing 85% and the sort 10% at the end
- make it only one column on mobile
- make the 'shop' use the same reusable format as the blogs page. 
- extract the 'item' into its own shared component so im not reusing code???
- sort out the sort button styling... again...
- fix the opening page - top part of it - on mobile
    - --> when overflow x....
- could have it where by deffault, it shows the logos of the filters, but then when you expand it to full, it shows the text as well????????



- add the filter button...
- Add the feature where on filter button clicked, it hides everythin, like the language select, and shows only the filters, with button always visible 'search' / 'apply' / 'view results'




- sort button styling broken... again...
- consider centring the sort button
- consider making the blogs page just have big squares in 2 columns... just so it looks good and i can move on with my life.
- 


- Add price to example elements (and date) so i can integrate sort.
- Make sort work per section. (e.g. products; sort blogs)
- create the seperate blogs page

----------------------------------------------------

- work on the blogs
    - get the blogs all importing the global blogs css 

- make search bar clickable from anywhere
- same for other buttons on the home page.
- implement filtering thing where turning off colour doesn't affect
- implement filter saves to URL.
- implement changing language changes the URL to en-...
- Update the landing page on desktop- side buttons should take up the width of the entire page, but then the contents should be padded by loads so that it appears as if the buttons are in a nice legible position.


# Longer term road map
- Get all of the links on the home page going to actual pages
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
