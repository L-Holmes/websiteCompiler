todo coding

- add the 'more filters' button (with a '...'?)
    - Add the feature where on filter button clicked, it hides everythin, like the language select, and shows only the filters, with button always visible 'search' / 'apply' / 'view results'
- extract the 'item' into its own shared component so im not reusing code???


- Add price to example elements (and date) so i can integrate sort.


## Considerations
for the blogs / products, consider having no columns? and just having a fixed width for the boxes so that they flow better and sort easier?
    - so they are say 40% width, so then on flow they automatically go into 2 columns????

# Longer term road map
- Get all of the links on the home page going to actual pages
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
