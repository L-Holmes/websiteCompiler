- Sort options don't fit on page on mobile, you have to scroll laterallly... 
- really need to clear the products/blogs filters when going back to the main page........
    - just when the page loads, check for them, check against the whitelist(?) (contains 'products' or 'blogs'?? or not even?), and remove them...

coding TODO:
- Start writing blogs
- Figure out what to do with the 
- Start setting up pages for all my blogs.

other TODO:
- look into market research;
    - usability of limited people
    - how to do user interviews.

other other coding related...
- Add actual content for each 
- Add actual filters for each
- Add actual key for each
- Add search results...
- Add guide for all of the above!

--------------------
- Get help pages / all required ones sorted + some example product pages.
    - especially donate etc.
    - do i have 'support us' AND 'donate'?
- Make notes and plan on user interviews.
    - (ideally both for 'usability for dumb people' and for 'optimal website design')
- Get some user interview feedback.
- Add all the content!

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...
- Links to podcast / youtube????

# Longer term road map
-> get some feedback from people on the general design.
-> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.

# donation buttons;
'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list???'?
    --> But for products, name it like the benefits you get "Join our community (We want you!(re intelligence!) "'
