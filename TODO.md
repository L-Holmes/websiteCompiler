Priority list for blogs:
- Other resources
    - Add to the blogs page list
    - Get page looking like I want (with maybe links at the top to return back to blogs?)
    - Add content 
        - (particularly the actionable takeaways)
- Minimising negativity
- Road map
- Average day in the life
- Paleo diet 
- <legal / help pages>
    - Particularly the 'donate' / 'why support us page' first.
    - support us _and_ donate?
- relationship stuff
- day planning

- <other things linked to on the 'start here' page>
- <pages that I find helpful>
- <essential things>

--------------------
- + perhaps maybe some things that don't take as much thinking power? (when I'm too drained/multitasking to do blogs?)
--------------------

# Possible issue when changing between pages
- really need to clear the products/blogs filters when going back to the main page........
    - just when the page loads, check for them, check against the whitelist(?) (contains 'products' or 'blogs'?? or not even?), and remove them...

# Market research
- look into market research;
    - usability of limited people
    - how to do user interviews.
-> get some feedback from people on the general design.

- Make notes and plan on user interviews.
    - (ideally both for 'usability for dumb people' and for 'optimal website design')
- Get some user interview feedback.

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...
- Links to podcast / youtube????

# Longer term road map
-> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 

# donation buttons;
'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list???'?
    --> But for products, name it like the benefits you get "Join our community (We want you!(re intelligence!) "'
# Later
- Finish off things like the blogs with the goals of the website etc.
    - just the start here page stuff and the pages it links to...
