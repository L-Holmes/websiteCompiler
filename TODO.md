    - maybe want to look through the below todo..
- Make great progress on the 'new? start here' page.
- maybe get a priority lits of blogs to write?
    - defo things like the road map...
    - and the 'average day in the life'
    - and some of the more essential things
    - and the pages that I find helpful...
- + perhaps maybe some things that don't take as much thinking power?
- May also want to start making the blogs accessible via the blogs page...








- Sort options don't fit on page on mobile, you have to scroll laterallly... 
- really need to clear the products/blogs filters when going back to the main page........
    - just when the page loads, check for them, check against the whitelist(?) (contains 'products' or 'blogs'?? or not even?), and remove them...

    - (ideally both for 'usability for dumb people' and for 'optimal website design')
- Get some user interview feedback.
- Add all the content!

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...

# Longer term road map
-> get some feedback from people on the general design.
-> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.

# donation buttons;
'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list???'?
    --> But for products, name it like the benefits you get "Join our community (We want you!(re intelligence!) "'
