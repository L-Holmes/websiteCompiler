- language icon appears to be missing on mobile..
- there is a starnge overlap where it switches from mobile back to desktop for a split second...
- search results;
    - + implement sort popup for mobile...
    - Sort out the 'close popup' icon for the search results.

- (don't) Add the donation buttons
    - + consider what else I need... is it just donations?
    - perhaps a contact??
    -->
    Hmmmmmmmmmm
    Would it be cleaner to have 'how to support us' as the default option in the blogs/products list????
    --> But for products, name it like the benefits you get "Join our community (We want you!(re intelligence!) "
- add filters for the 'new here' and 'help' etc. + work out how to do that... seperate pages? 
- Update the primary text to something more readable...
- discrepancy with compiled languages;
    - Start-here/start-here.html exists
    - en-start-here.html exists... 
    - but we need them to be the same or else the page is missing.

# Other things to consider;
- Sponsers / Advertisements / Affiliate links page????
    - would these be part of the 'support us' page?
    - i think links to reddit etc. would be on there...
- Links to podcast / youtube????

# Longer term road map
- Launch my website as a github website
    -> get some feedback from people on the general design.
    -> re-watch / read about the user interviews guideance on ycombinator 
- Get the road map sorted
- Get some basic blogs up with the goals of the website etc.
