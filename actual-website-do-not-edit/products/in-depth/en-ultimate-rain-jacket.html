- Single layer, 0-2 CFM cotton, waxed
- Reglan arms [2]
- Cinch* waist
- Cinch* Neck/Hood

* Maybe a cinch band. I feel wind can get under a thin cinch easier.
[1] - Most waterproof natural material that is...
        - easy to produce 
        - Not crazy expensive
    - ... generaly does the job for most light rain scenarios.
    - ... May want to layer or even use nylon/poly if facing more extreme rain (or in a more life threatening scenario)
[2] - No seams on the top of arms to let water through
