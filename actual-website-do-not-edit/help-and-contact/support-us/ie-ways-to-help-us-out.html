            <h2> Donations </h2>
            <h3> Why donate </h3>
            I'll convince you in 5 minutes to donate to me
            [Not charity, not random YouTubers, not startups me]

            Imagine future you.. telling your grandchildren... Seeing on the news, you name out there.

            This is for the logical people we want you. You are important to our success. We succeed together (big hyped up speech)

            Benefits:

            first 5, one will get £10.

            first 10, one will get £10

            first 100, one will get £10

            need a way to prove I'm not rigging it! (No fake email lists, no just me random picking...)

            Give glory? Let them help people?
