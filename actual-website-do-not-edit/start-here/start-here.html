            WHY TRUST US

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h4> general about us </h4>

            <div> I don't go too extreme; </div>
            <li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
            <li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
            <li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
            <li> I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. </li>

            <div> *i.e. We prioritise. We aim to only optimise as much as we need to.* </div>

            <div> 
                Now, as a general rule, we cut down our sentences as much as possible, to give you only the information you need. This will be the last ever of these wordy sentences you will read on this _entire website_ (assuming everything goes to plan)

            -----------
            # why we need more than podcasts / a new approach.
            Podcasts are great.
                - But that's all we have right now, as far as life advice goes...
                - They are entertaining, but:
                    - Its difficult to go back and 'revise' the learnings
                    - Sometimes they are entertaining, but perhaps no clear actionable things that you can focus on.
                        - Often sometimes can be meaningless inspiration which lasts until your regular life gets back at you
