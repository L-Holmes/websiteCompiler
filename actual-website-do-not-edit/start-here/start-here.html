                            <li>Things that are niche to a particular place (we focus on the uk, here and now. Many other countries are quite similar and so can likely take similar benefit to most of our writings, we hope.)</li>

                        <li>+ Main Mental things like: loneliness, safety, security (no big stressors which would ruin your life if not met)</li>
                        <li>++ Minor things: paleo, fitness?? </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    (3) Fixing failures of the modern lifestyle
                    - vitamin d 
                    - lack of social interaction
                    - micro plastics 
                    - diet 
                    - dopamine overload

            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>

            <h3> A few other core beliefs </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most decisions can be grounded in evolution and our ancestor's lives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make contentness easier by lowering your dopamine threshold.

                    <h5> What benefit? (what makes this website different + proof (not just claims) of usefulness to the readers life) </h5> 
                    <div> Why? We expect our readers to be intelligent; to value their time. Hence they;
                        - Want to determine whether a page is useful / worth reading within a few seconds
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h5> Are there wasted words? Is it overly wordy or just straight facts/thoughts? </h5> 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h5> Are the topics being covered relevant to my life? </h5> 
                </li>

                    --> Is it logically organised? Nice headers, bullet points, clearly seperated sections and sentences / paragraphs
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> Our general rules </h3>

            <ul>
                <li> - No complicated words </li>
                <li> - Open minded </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> Our website-specific rules </h3>

            <ul>
                <li> - Set an example of what we want to web/guides to be like (respecting the user first and foremost) </li>
                <li> - Reflect what we say in our website design etc. Advice first, money second</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>

            <h3> Rambling</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> Money is not one of the start-point things, when looking at life as a whole.</li>
                <li>You have:
                    - Your time
                    - What you are doing in that time
                </li>

                With what you are doing in that time... you're either...
                - enjoying the moment
                - building a better future

                (or both... or enduring something bad until you get to a stable 'free' point...)

                Building a better future can be done through;
                - money
                - career
                - choicess
                - health, physical and/or mental
                - social
                - planning
                - choices
                - knowledge/research
                - etc.

            Make our team happy 
            <ul>
            <li>-> Yep, we're not going to hide the truth.</li>
            <li>-> We created ..</li>
            <li>-> But at least we are sticking to our principles...</li>
            <li>-> But luckily we get happy from helping others...</li>
            <li> Giving me more money</li>
            <li> New people will stay on the site</li>
            <li> New people will be inspired to tell others about the site -> use psychological tricks to keep them -> quick information (short attention span), easy digestable info , etc.</li>
            <li> Giving me satisfaction</li>
            <li> Repect -> Well organised, logical, science backed-up.</li>
            <li> Aligning with my goals -></li>
            <li> ? -> Reflecting the intelligent theories by having an intelligent design</li>
            </ul>
            - 

            How much emphasis on different goals?
            <ul>
                <li> 90% money.</li>
                <li> 10% logic. </li>
                <li> This is actual trivial. The content etc will provide the logic. </li>
                <li> yeah just make it with money in mind, and everything else will work out. </li>
                <li> (the requirements of logic, repspect, satisfaction will keep the money requirement from getting out of hand.)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
            <h3> general about us </h3>

            I don't go too extreme;
            <li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
            <li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
            <li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
