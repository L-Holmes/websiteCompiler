<h3>Us benefiting you side notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A lot of the things we discussed are long term minimal non obvious things. So measuring there success will be very difficult!
        <ul>
            <li>e.g. if reducing microplastics consumption by 40% decreases your chance of dementia by 2% over the course of your lifetime... can we measure that?</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Why we sometimes rely on non-scientific papers as evidence</h3>
<div> i.e. Ancestral theory, or just speculation / common sense type stuff </div>
<ul>
    <li> Science has been wrong in the past </li>
    <li> Something are very hard to prove with science (Particularly long term, minimal changes...) </li>
    <li> Some things simply aren't covered by science, and we don't have time to wait </li>
</ul>
