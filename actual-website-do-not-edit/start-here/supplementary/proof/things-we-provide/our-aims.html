<h3> Main overarching aim </h3>
<div>
    With the aim of minimising the total negative emotions that you experience in your life
    <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="Excluding medical conditions. Generally aimed at the average person who has solved/identified the obvious detractors in life, and wants to optimise further and achieve their best life.">*</sup>
</div>

GENERAL AIMS BEHIND ALL OF OUR THINGS WHICH WE BELIEVE WORK TOWARDS THE CLAIMED BENEFIT TO YOU

<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
<h3> What we aim to do </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Explore every single thing investigated in science that relates to health and thus happiness</li>
    <li> Create theories based on ancesteral thoughts/findings</li>
    <li> preventing common things, like dementia, joint issues etc.</li>
    <li> Negativity score</li>
    <li> Mapping out the biggest causes of negatvity... (joint pain...)</li>
</ul>

We will not cover:

<ul>
    <li> things that treat specific medical conditions</li>
    <li>-> Not relevant to our wider audience.</li>
    <li>-> Can generally be researched seperately / you can see a specialist hopefully.</li>
    <li> papers that don't learn anything / aren't relevant</li>
    <li> unnecessary papers that just aren't helpful / repeat things we already know</li>
    <li> papers on AI / physics / natural phenomenon / maths proofs / ways of writing better etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
But what type of content and how does that help?
<h3> We aim to make our content... </h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        - Increase the probability of you going down a life path that has a lower negativity score*
        <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="'Negativity score' meaning a lower total of negative moments in your life">*</sup>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li> This will be likely be influenced by you changing your daily habits/thoughts /life path, based on our writings.  </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
<h3> aims / philosophy behind our stuff that we believe make it likely that they will work towards achieving the claimed benefit of lowering your life negativity </h3>
<ul>
    <li>We aim that consuming our material will increase the probability of you taking a life path that is equal to or better than the one you have now (diagram showing the different life paths, and ones with positive outcomes and those with negative outcomes)</li>
    <li>roadmap -- we prioritise strictly; we have a clear action plan for the future (more so why support / stick with us.... more proof of our competence we like to think)</li>
    <li>philosophy (again, we believe this increases our chance of us being trustworthy and maximally beneficial in sl to the reader.. don't have proof why though because the proof is in the pudding...)</li>
</ul>

<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
<h3> What this website specifically aims to do </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Attempts to get all actionable, general scientific strategies in one place </li>
    <li> Looks at life through the minimising negativity aims </li>
    <li> Be a model for the most user-friendly website... </li>
    <li> Attempt to communicate life advice in the most direct, concise way possible </li>
</ul>

<div class="vert-spacing-s"></div>
<h3> Secondary aims </h3>
<ul>
    <li> [not wasting your time etc?]</li>
    <li> [get info across as fast as possible?]</li>
    <li> singular location with all the info you need, in the most concise format possible.</li>
    <li> Replace the need for constant research / finding stuff out
        <ul>
            <li> We aim to be the only place you need to go to for useful advice </li>
            <li> No more hours of scrolling through forums or watching videos... </li>
            <li> --> All that you actually need will be here. </li>
            <li> --> ... any lifestyle tips, or essential things.. </li>
            <li> --> ... anything else will be obvious... clear medical issues you have.. clear mechanical car issues etc. </li>
            <li> --> ... we just want to make it so you spend less time trying to stumble on facts... </li>

            <li> And no, for the record it is not: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Things that are extremely unlikely (e.g. surviving being stung by a box jellyfish</li>
                <li>Things that only happen to risky people</li>
                <li>Things that are niche to a particular place (we focus on the uk, here and now. Many other countries are quite similar and so can likely take similar benefit to most of our writings, we hope.)</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> replace ai ...</li>
    <li> become the only place on the internet...</li>
    <li> act as the example for a useable website...</li>
    <li> etc.</li>
    <li> Try and use science and 'reason' </li>
    <li>/ [logic/rationality... although these are loaded 'nerdy' terms.. and make us sound like we're full of ourselves. We try not to be and do not want to reflect that, so hopefully this is the last time you'll read that!]</li>
</ul>


<div> achive best life <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="'best' meaning minimal negativity score, by our definition">*</sup> track possible. We want to share that and grow our knowledge with everyone </div>


### Aiming to optimise 


<div> I don't go too extreme; </div>
<li> don't buy new clothes for 10g saving...</li>
<li> If I had to wear heeled dress shoes to get a partner.. I would. Many years of loneliness to have a small chance of increased pain, and a bit more discomfort.. </li>
<li> I wash myself and my hair, as social inclusion is so much more important than whatever micro benefits I may gain by not doing. </li>
<li> I do the bare minimum for adequate social acceptance</li>
<li> I revert back to our ancestral ways, then make the bare minimum changes (e.g. warm house, washing, using tech, etc.) to just-about solve the issues I'd face as a natural hunter gatherer, whilst also functioning well in modern day society. </li>

<div> *i.e. We prioritise. We aim to only optimise as much as we need to.* </div>

<div> 
    Now, as a general rule, we cut down our sentences as much as possible, to give you only the information you need. This will be the last ever of these wordy sentences you will read on this _entire website_ (assuming everything goes to plan) 
</div>
