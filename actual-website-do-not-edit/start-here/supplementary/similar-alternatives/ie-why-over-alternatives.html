    <li>Compared to traditional podcasts, our website will (hopefully/possibly);
        <ul>
            <li>Be more concise</li>
            <li>Have less non-essential information <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="(or non-essential things will be more obviously labelled)">*</sup> </li>
            <li>Have more things you can learn and act upon</li>

        </ul>

    <li>We have lots of rules and measure which aim to give you a better experience and help you achieve your goals better [This is explored into the rest of this page -- thing alike efficient website design, roadmap? etc]</li>
    <li>Our content aims to be...

<h4> More accurate findings </h4>
<ul>
    <li>We will always update our suggestions based on new findings, and make these changes clear.</li>
    <li>For us to mention something, it muts ideally be grounded in logic, science and evolution theory. Ideally as many of those as possible.</li>
    <li>i.e. scientific drug / diet claims that aren't matching with evolutionary expectations / 'common sense' (for lack of a better phrase) won't necessarily be recommended. 
        e.g. Not eating eggs... all unsaturated fat bad... take all these probiotics and vitimins and protein...

# Measures:
- Information density
    - Amount of sentences/words that are directly actionable
    - Percentage Relative the the most dense/concise amount
    - e.g. Us = 100%; Huberman = 30%; chris willx = 1%...
- Num. topics covered
    - e.g. Us = 120; Huberman = 30
- % of topics that are actually relevant to giving people a better life
    - e.g. Us = 100; Huberman = 80, ...
- % of topics which are actionable
    - e.g. Us = 100; Huberman = 40 (still very good!)
- % of things that are not false information
    - e.g. Things like roka glasses...
    - e.g. Things like supplements when you don't have deficiencies
    - e.g. Things like probiotics
    - e.g. Us = 100

- Time taken to find every single life advice strategy
    - Us = 5 mins
    - Huberman = 500 hours...
- Consideration of money in every decision
    - We don't ignore that money is what allows us to buy away sadness
    - We scrutinize every single decision against the predicted amount of negatvity it will take away / result in...
- Consideration of how much each actionable thing will affect your life
    - So you can prioritise and optimise which you do / which approach you take.
- Evaluations/predictions on reliability and safety and accuracy
    - i.e. science is inherently flawed and has been proven to do so many times over the years
    - so many conflicting recommendations... just look at diets. They all seem right. But there is no clear answer.
    - Our evlautation of paleo principles, we beleive (Based of analyusing past things in science that have turned out to be true / false.. and using common sense on whether we would have evolved to do something...)
      that grounding in paleo / etc. allows our recommendations to be as accurate as possible.


(uncategorised)
- ever regretted buying a really expensive supplement or product and not really feeling its essential to your life or that the money could have been better placed?
    - Yep -we don't want that. We optimise against that...
- Even if huberman makes a knowledge repository... 
    - We'll still be different by:
        - Our unique approach to paleo / ancestral grounding of the thoughts
        - Our concise writing style 
        - etc.
- What actually makes us better?
    - We cover a wider range of topics *{more areas in your life with less negatvitiy -> lower total negativity score}
    - Our stuff is grounded in paelo *{we beleive less chance of false data / things that won't significantly affect your life}
    - Logical approach
    - Go extreme in evaluating whether something is worth your time and money *{not just whether it benefits you... but the extent, and the worth of investing in that}
    - We show knowldge, not sponsers
- e.g. Covering sunshine. Huberman lab vs. us;
    - 1 single line vs. 2 hour podcast
    - Both grounded in paelo
    - Ours easier to find
    - Ours more easily backed up by science proof
    - How we organise things to make easy to find
    - How we group/list things
    - No incorrect / questionable data / recommednations (liek supplements... red light)
    - we do lots of money optimisation in our evaluations
    - we are relevant to everyone (no specific deep dives on like adhd... sure you can skip the episode but still)
    - No false claims about rich quick
- <h1> Statistically, what does this result in for you? (an estimate) </h1>
    - 70% less reading time
    - 5-100% more actions that you took which affected  your life
    - greater negativity loss
    - greater significant negativity loss (due to our prioritisation system)
    - less regrets
- You find, be motivated and act.

Why we 'lack' (even though they aren't really negatives)
- Digestability for the average person (giving more money for the podcast people)
    - e.g. Us = 20% - We are not optimised for that!
- Stories 
- Person saying it is an 'expert in their field' 
    - e.g. Us = 1%
    - We rely on the findings of experts
    - Although this also means we don't have any 'false' experts
    - We don't beleive anything and assume by default that most science experiments are flawed / missing things.


# What if [huberman lab] covers same topics as you, and creates a guide with just as much?
- (a) It will be hard to reach our 100%...
- (b) We will still be...
    - Hitting more 
    - Covering less things that don't help
    - and ultimately... we believe..
        - lowering your negativity score more...
        - giving you a better life.


# Limitations of podcasts


-----------
# why we need more than podcasts / a new approach.
Podcasts are great.
- But that's all we have right now, as far as life advice goes...
- They are entertaining, but:
    - Its difficult to go back and 'revise' the learnings
    - Sometimes they are entertaining, but perhaps no clear actionable things that you can focus on.
        - Often sometimes can be meaningless inspiration which lasts until your regular life gets back at you

- Podcasts are great for when you are driving.
- Or when you just need entertaining / reminding / motivating
