        <div> More of a slave to science outcomes, from his researchers... Mixing up correlations with absolute reflections and guarantees (If I work out my forearms everyday then I will live longer? Or his very limited diet? Just doesn't add up...)<div>

There are also many, many other blogs. 
But most of them:
- Just list blogs by time order
    - No order or simbilance
    - Maybe Some of those blogs would be useful...
- Write in a non-precise way
- Include many opinions
- Some include more controversial thoughts
- Aren't intended to be an accurate guideance, more of just a thoughts sharing thing
