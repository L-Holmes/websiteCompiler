The perfect business plan:
    - why don't more people do it?
    - Really good product for free. Optional extras people *choose* to buy
        - e.g. Parking + reserve spot / shaded spot / vending machines
        - e.g. Nice tourist attraction
        - e.g. Blog / Advice website -> products being sold.
        - e.g. Software + extras...
    --> "You have to pay this..." vs. "If you pay this, you get a benefit"
        -> If you pay extra you get ice cream included! (unlimited on tuesday mornings!)
