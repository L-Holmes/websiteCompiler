Have to deal with cusomters, not just your boss.
    --> more difficult to get stable customers...

You have to make so much more money!
- 
- running the business...
- accounting for non-stable money flow...

Its notoriously difficult
- chinese company at any time swoop in and steal your ideas...
- big massive conglomerates could shut you down...
- You aren't just competing in a town, its against the world... and mega companies...
    - Its like the paradox of online dating... Bigger pool, but worse people and less choice...
