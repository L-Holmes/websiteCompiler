# Its not for everyone!
- lots of people are content in everyday jobs, prefer the stability and being told what to do!

# idea generating
- identify every-day item optimisations, based off my life aims
--> e.g. raise lower desk
- identified things/resources I want, in my hobbies etc. 
--> e.g. badminton stats website

# life plan
- get a flexible job (e.g. work from home) that minimises my struggles 
--> IBS so work from home
--> anxiety / struggle with people, so job with minimal people interaction 

# other
- constantly thinking 'what do I want' and then not thinking 'awr that's annoying, I really want that, but instead 'yes that's a business idea!' 
- evaluate the big list of ideas, think what's best

# if nothing else works
- can at least pick an easy, reliable startup (e.g. cafe, builder etc), and think how to refine it.
- if you can't think how to refine it, ask the cleverest people you know. Brainstorm ideas through multiple people 

# put yourself in a position to succeed
- get a cheap, nice house
- minimise expenses best you can 
- make use of government schemes if there are any 

# key points:
- People will always strive for proven health benefits
- Most people aren't smart enough to optimise their companies. If they are, move somewhere were they aren't. 

# obvious stuff
- Know your limits, and set the goal for the company to be way under them (e.g  not working 80 hours a week!) 
- plan out everything to the micro degree, and ideally ruminate for 6 months to a year, asking lots of trustworthy people hether they think it will fail. 
Look for failure suggestions, not success!


# you must be positive that even in the eyes case scenario that you will succeed
- if the rent goes up 150%, which could feasibly happen based off of past trends and possibly likely future catastrophies, and then rival shops open up, and no one likes your food, will you still be in a good position?
