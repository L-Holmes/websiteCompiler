### Some examples of great walks I've had which on-paper, wouldn't seem great.
- relationship discussions in french forest
- falling in ravine
- falling in muddy puddles
- falling in snow river, again

======
Order of importance when evaluating;
- Company
- Walk distance
- Nature (no car/plane sounds! No annoying dogs/people, natural, little paving etc. ) 
- Walk variety, for less interesting stretches
- Weather (either extreme weather or nice weather...) Just quite windy and quite on off rain annoying..
- Nice scenery... (rivers, lakes, waterfalls, hills, gorges...) 


Other unexpected bonuses
- I enjoy walks with lots of other nice people having a good time.
    - Not honey pot sites with loads of tourists with phones
    - But people enjoying out hiking.
