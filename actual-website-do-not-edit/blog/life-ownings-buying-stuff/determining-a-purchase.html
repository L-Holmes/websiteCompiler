1) How much will this purchase decrease my lifetime negativity score?

TODO
- how much is £10 worth in decreasing negativity score?
It's odd because I feel it is non linear.
Like it could go towards a life changing drug and stop crippling pain...
but if you've already bought a lifetime supply then is that fact null and void?
It could buy transport that enables visiting and socialising etc...
Some things you aren't aware of how important they are until it happens.. like parkrun and meeting my partner... or just fuel money to visit nick who then introduced us...

then how much is £10 to someone who is rich? Surely nothing!? they dlcoupd spend on whatever... 

do I need to sort of predict the future in some way? 
obviously not ideal but... 
Like things that;
- Build social
- decrease issues later on (joints... microplastics)... 

e.g. 
For the merino t-shirt 
£70

--------
- exhibit (A) - wears sports tops almost every day...

options:
(A) Wear existing cotton tops. 
- Save £80...
- 5% increase in daily weight
- At least 40% time don't fix l stick to it... shedding a probably insignificant amount of microplastics...

(B) Buy lightweight cheap cotton tops 
- Same as (A) but spend more money... 

(C) Buy lightweight natural sports tops
- Probably less microplastics consumed, very very small degree... 
- spend £90....

### Things it affects (+ my prediction of how that will affect negativity score); 
- Decreases microplastics consumption by maybe 0.5%
- --> Decrease dementia things by maybe 0.1% 
- Increases weight by maybe 10 g
- --> Increase knee risk by maybe 0.0001%

### Other ways that could be spent 
##### social -> partner
- 1 night stay at hotel

##### social -> building other bonds 
- [activities with close to-be friends]

--------------------

help me determine whether to get a new t-shirt. 
I have the funds available. Maybe around 1000 pounds per month spare, and no big issues coming up, all main things sorted for. 
the reason I'm thinking of getting the new t-shirt is to replace my existing ones. it is slightly heavier, but has a much smaller plastic content. 
Historically I've been too lazy to switch my shirts, so end up wearing my plastic ones inside, so I assume that will continue unless something drastically changes?!? although maybe if I get into a habit... hmm. 

I'm unsure of the total affect that making the change will have on my life. 
specially because of the lack of knowledge on microplastics. 
I suspect that I'm better to not make the purchase... 
But then at the same time, that is sort of saying I'll have trh same t-shirts for the next 60 years which just seems crazy. And now when I think that I think maybe I would rather have the one with less plastic as we are unsure, so would assume that would be the better option long term

it's not that though... it's just £70 feels like a lot for a t-shirt... when there is no clear benefit to it.. like it is only suspected benefit, and even then it is probably insignificant and inconsequential. 
So it's not a matter of whether I can afford it or whether I'd wear it, it's whether that money could have been spent elsewhere ina  weah that would decrease my lifetime negativity. 
Just over optimising. 

It's not that I can choose both options with my money as well.. 
I'm assuming that most of that money will actually go towards future medical bills, moving, emergencies, etc... 
And even then it wouldn't be £70 partner trip AND the top, it would be two £70 trips, or £70 of medication and £70 trip... 
etc. 

How could I keep face knowing that I have effectively wasted £70 that could have been used in a better way? 
How can I reasonably go to my partner and say "I have spent the £70 on a t-shirt, yes, a t-shirt to play sports in. Yes it still is 10% polyester but I'm never going to realistically care for 100% wool, and as far as I can tell, cotton isn't appropriate as it is super uncomfortable and heavy absorbing all that water... (although maybe I'm wrong and should suck it up...). In my prediction, there is around UK nd a 99% chance that it does not affect my life at all. and a 1% that I get dementia maybe a minute earlier, or with 0.01% worse intensity. But I'm not sure. Yes I could have spent that on you... or something more certain, but I didn't. Hell, in the time I've spent here writing this I could have made enough money to buy it outright... but.. hey ho, that was never going to happen. Anyway, I know you won't approve of this decision because to me, on paper, it seems like the wrong decision. But then again, that £70 realistically wouldn't have had a direct better usage.. and it is spent on one of the few things we know are dangerous.. but we don't know just how dangerous quite yet... although we can make pretty decent estimations "

-------
when is the cut off point??
getting it bs not, monetarily wise? 

How would my life change after getting it? which path is likely to be better? 

Any cheaper alternatives? (no)
montbell pants, c concert to shorts!??!?

# big insight!!!!!!
# "The deliberation is the waste, not the shirt "
ahhhhh but it's not wasted because
- Those thoughts were driven by my motivation.
- I had no motivation for anything else, so it was that, or nothing. 
- . 3rd person. I'm an NPC. I won't change, I need to respect that.


---
clothes:
- Indoor:
- --> min amount to wear? (or heat house less!? I'd say heat the house..)
- Then additional payer after you wake and are cold.
- Base:
- --> Shorts, inbuilt boxers possible? or just thick material around crotch? (don't want to waste time changing after wake up! time is precious!) (or is it as that changing time realistically is small and wouldn't affect the dayh- probs just spent lounging... 
- --> Vest (washable )
- --> cashmere vest (affordable but still amx insulation)
- + morning layer
--> single payer dense cotton with pull tags for trapping in the air (at least a short sleeve, if not more).

=====================================================================

# IN FACT
- I ultimately decided against it
    - why?
    - We are much less sure on the microplastics front than the weight savings front.
        - So I'm thinking 100% natural is probs better.
    - I think I overblew how unbearable cotton is to wear when doing sports, after having a review
