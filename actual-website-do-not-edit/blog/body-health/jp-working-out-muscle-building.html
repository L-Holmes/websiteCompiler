# so
- Most optimal for when you start to lose muscle. 

# Should you go to the gym?
the gym, for most isn't about working out. 
Most people can work out at home. 
Gym machine make it easier to.wrokout and hit things.
it's for the social aspect and motivation increase. 
Don't go to the gym unless your friends / family / partner (the people you care about etc).

you should go for reason;
- You lack motivation
- You are not doing anything else
- The people around you will not miss out on your presence (e.g. your partner is at their  own club, and your kids are at a friend's house, you've been working and have noore energy to work or you have no practic work to do)
- You have a friend at the gym / a place to work out with friends
- You have lots of spare money.

getting the extra muscle likely won't affect how you age. Otherwise doctors would be prescribing steroids. They don't because any positives are very small. 
Getting to 80% of your limit at home will likely be enough. 
Appearance wise you're doing it for your own ego. 
If your partner cares about that 10% more than the time of you being together... You may be in for a rocky relationship.
