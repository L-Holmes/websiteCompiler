Key Point: Maximise the amount of productive time vs. non-productive time

Reminder:
- 'Productive time' when de-stressing = the time needed to reach a baseline level of non-stressed, satisfied, contentness

E.g. 1)
- Lets approximate that it takes 20 mins of aerobic excercise

Options:
1) Parkrun, 30 min drive away = *2 hours* of time used!
    - [Missed out on sleep, because wake up early]
    - 30 mins drive
    - 20 mins to park early
    - 40 mins to parkrun and back to car
    - 30 mins drive back
    - 30 mins get in, shower, etc.
2) Local run, from door = *50 mins* of time used!
    - 20 mins to run 
    - 30 mins to get in, shower, etc.
    ---------------------------------
    = 1h 10m time saved!

E.g. 2)
- Lets approximate that it takes a 20 min to return to baseline
1) Interesting walk in the lake district = *4h 25m*!
    - 45 mins drive + parkup
    - 3 hours walk
    - 40 mins back
2) Local walk from house = 20 mins!
    - 20 mins walk
    ---------------------------------
    = 4h 5m time saved!
