<h3> The real paleo diet </h3>
- we are still guessing
- # Actual paleo doesn't work! It depends on the person's ancestors!
- aka the Awpen diet... 


<h3> Lose-weight dieting mistakes </h3>
- WE ARE NOT EXPERTS
- Not going for sustainability / focus on satiation

- Have a primary aim to improve mocrobiota through eating natural foods that promote good bacteria to grow. 
-> diverse, natural, what our ancestors ate. 

Key points:
- Our gut mocrobiota completely changes depending on what we eat! 

Issues with low fodmap:
- since you don't eat fodmaps, your gut doesn't grow the bacteria to deal with fodmaps! So any 'elimination' diet will always fail.
- we know that beneficial bacteria like bifobacterium are good, but they only grow when we consume fodmaps like onions! 

Possible theory on why I got ill;
- eating bad food (Chinese, etc) upset my microbiome. 
- since I have anxiety, that out me at a higher risk. (Hormones and puberty, life changes etc. intensified this) 
- cutting out fodmaps and eating a high carb diet made things worse. My gut bacteria completely messed up
- the IBS symptoms then made my anxiety and stress go through the roof. 
- my body learned to associate any irritation with issue. My gut has trauma. 

I.e.
Any thoughts on why a lot of people develop IBS straight after puberty finish? 

-----------------------------------
is it that individuals who have a genetic predisposition to anxiety, the hormones etc in puberty bring this out, and then after a traumatic gut event (e.g. food poisoning) , there guy mocrobiota gets messed up, and then they can't recover because of the anxiety (which has come on since puberty)? and then the combination of IBS, anxiety and a 'bad gut' diet of low fibre white bread / cereals / sugar / rice etc. cause things to spiral cause they each affect each other, causing things to get worse? 
-------------------------
**The Perfect Storm (Your Hypothesis Summarized):**

1. **Vulnerability Established:** Genetic predisposition to anxiety/stress sensitivity.
2. **Vulnerability Activated:** Puberty - hormones and brain maturation unmask anxiety/stress vulnerability.
3. **Trigger:** A gut infection (food poisoning) causes direct damage, inflammation, and dysbiosis.
4. **Failure to Recover:** Underlying anxiety/stress prevents full healing by maintaining gut dysfunction, inflammation, and dysbiosis via the gut-brain axis.
5. **Symptom-Driven Diet:** Gut symptoms lead to adoption of a low-fiber, high-refined-carb "safe" diet.
6. **Spiral:** The low-fiber diet starves good bacteria, worsens dysbiosis and inflammation, and further disrupts gut function. Ongoing gut symptoms fuel more anxiety/stress. Anxiety promotes poor dietary choices. The cycle intensifies, solidifying IBS.

-------------------------

Thus, fixing;
- Remove harmful carbs etc.
- *slowly* introduce other things, so my bacteria can build up without freaking out (like with a peanut allergy)
- eat probiotics etc. along the way.


------------
To prevent for people:
- Avoid food poisoning / traumatic food events (i.e. no dodgy Chinese eating out) 
- Understand that anxiety may still cause IBS symptoms. Treat as needed, but then focus on keeping the gut fauna healthy. Perhaps eat less fodmaps only when about to have a very stressful event / just had one / are recovering. At all other times, slowly increase fodmaps. 
- keep people informed. Let them make the choice and know the consequences.
