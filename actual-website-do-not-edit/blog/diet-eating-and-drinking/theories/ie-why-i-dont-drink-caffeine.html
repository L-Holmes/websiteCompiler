- why I don't drink caffeine... 
--> baseline dopamine
--> baseline stimulation
--> paleo (only do what youbkdy is designed to do) argument
--> using caffeine as a tool (your body gets used to it otherwise) 
--> of course it going to help you cntrate better! It's a stimulant! It's tastes nice! It's like the controversial ADHD people with some people saying they just get bored easily. If you wouldn't do the extreme, why do the lesser? Why raise your baseline?
