My requirements for a language, in order roof importance;
1) Absolute longevity, will run for the foreseeable future and have a be likely to have a wide user base in years to come, or at least be trivial to upgrade to whatever is next
2) Be super fast after being compiled
3) Be a compiled language
4) Have strict type declarations (no 'let x = 5 etc)
5) Have super detailed and helpful error messages 
6) not overly complicated and impossible to code in (like c) 
7) excellent documentation available

--> rust.
