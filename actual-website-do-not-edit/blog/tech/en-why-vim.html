# how it minimises sadness

# Draws
- speed (both editting and opening vim itself)
- predictable, modified. No frustration like in word etc.
- Stable, unlikely to change into future
- very well maintained
- industry standard


# Is vim the best text editor?

# do you need a text editor?

# Why?
- why speed
    - use remaining time for activities that reduce sadness more
    - delay of waiting for programs / loading things / doing small tasks:
        - breaks your rhythm 
        - allows for boredom and dissatisfaction to creap up on you
    - Get down ideas faster
        - extreme example: Takes 20 hours to write 1 line, you'll forget ideas and won't be able to build off of them
        - Takes 0.1 seconds, you get down loads of ideas, leaving mind space for generating more ideas and working off of those.
