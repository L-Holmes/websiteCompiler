- Time where you aren't:
--> Being productive
--> Doing the absolute minimum to achieve productiveness
--> doing extra activity to encourage more long term satisfaction (e.g. long socialising)

Is wasted time.

Key example: driving.
- When in day trips, double all your driving times, to learn how much of your day you are losing to driving. 

To note:
- When I'm having a full 'off' day / activity day / date day, these rules don't apply. 
These are with other people which makes it not as bad
(Unless there is a bit were I am the passenger, or watching some not-great TV show, in which case I'll consider productiveness.
