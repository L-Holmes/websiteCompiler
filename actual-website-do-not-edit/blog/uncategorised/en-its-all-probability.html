Yes... dont be tricked about stuff like the lottery.
It isn't "I might win" 
Its you betting. Its gambling on a very low probability.
you may as well bet on the Cavs winning the championship because the chance of every one else getting injured is more likely than winning the lottery!
   BUT YOU'D NEVER DO THAT!
