            I like companies like <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"> Give well </a>. Very logical.


            But they don't really state an aim.


            <h2> Our aims for charity </h2> 
            <ul>
                <li> Minimise sadness in the world. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> What are *not* our aims </h2> 
            <ul>
                <li> Reducing the number of alive people who go on to die
                    ==> Those people can still experience negativity and cause negativity.
                    ==> More people = more difficult to help everyone.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Some important points </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Knowing what is immoral is difficult. Knowing who feels what and how bad it is.
                    Our 'solution' / 'best effort' is to approximate to <b> The more 'intelligent' a creature is, the more immoral it is to give it negative emotions. </b>
                    Also we know that mammals feel negativity strongly as we are mammals...
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> uncategorised </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    Things like diseases / natural issues are generally not as bad as hanous crimes like abduction and physical/emotional harm of another person.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Biases </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> We are bias towards creatures similar to us. 
                    Not only does that extend to 'humans' but also to people closer to us geographically, emotionally, etc.
                    At an extreme example, we care much more about our friends and family, or at least those other people who can directly impact the lives of our friends / family.
                </li>
