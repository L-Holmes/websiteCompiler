# influencer info issues 
- Many of the top ones are known to have recommended bad products 
(Links to the ag1 controversy etc.)
(Link to the mcleod vid) 
- a lot of the podcast is just talking about stuff. It's not just fact fact fact. Which don't get me wrong, taking up more time is good on say a long car ride etc. and it's nice to listen to actual conversations. But a quick summary for just fact learning would be good as well. 
- [recommending supplements etc. in general when not useful (MacLeod vid)
- getting guests on who talk nonsense
- Other general claims 
--> "science is always changing" no. 

+ Science from the 80s is a mess. 
I believe we are getting better, but clearly we haven't reached optimum yet. 



Instead: 
- precise info
- no confusing technical terms 
- Go with what is always right and actually makes sense to be right.

- don't go with backwards science. People understanding / looking into "why are our bodies designed to need these multivitmins' -> and then you'd realise it's diet related.
