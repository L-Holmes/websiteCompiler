            - Go cold turkey.
                - As long as it is on your mind, resisting is difficult. 
                - Its the habit that is hardest to break. Let the dopamine wear down.
                - It will feel impossible at first, and that your body is reacting stronger than others. But that is because you are in the loop.
            
            <h2> General strategies </h2>
            - Go somewhere where you are physically unable to access the thing.
                - E.g. a 2 week holiday (or ideally even longer if possible)
                - Be very wary when you get back!
            - If you can afford to have internet blockers... consider doing that... although this is generally an imperfect system.
            - If you can have an accountability partner, do it!

            <h2> Harsh truths </h2>
            - Self doubt / regret / sadness are not going to stop you.
            - If you're clever, you'll get around (internet) restrictions that you yourself have setup.
                - Time / Location (e.g. Not on your phone!) restrictions are better (e.g. 10 mins)
                - Whitelist even better.
                - Accountability partner even better...

            <h2> Don't waste your time... </h2>
            - Trying to find the perfect blocking app... Just 
            - Writing your own accountability software (very difficult in my experience)
                - I tried to write something which logged internet traffic
