- Take the cheap risky road, in general

- Order a random trader to inspect and do a job (always get an external inspector!) 
- Order a specific fitting clothing item (e.g. shoes) that isn't easily returnable
- Buy cheap mass produced furniture that isn't extremely basic (even a bench, I'd get John Lewis...)
- buy something pre-owned off a non perfect seller with extremely detailed and logical self written description 
-
