  Caveats:
  - wool things had very strenuous washing processes... done by professional washing teams...
  - Teams budgeted for shrinking.
  - Cotton dyed better and looked nicer... so for televised football, telling difference between teams... ease of washing, nice collars etc.. cotton would have been used.
  - Also in rugby, cotton was better to grip in the scrums...

highest paid that didn't rely on appearance etc...

baseball - wool flannel 
Everest - ventile, for waterproofness... 
cyclists- wool... 


some boxers, athletes, etc used cotton... 


### conclusion
- If you're caring for it... worsted Wool
- If you're not caring for it.. mercerized Egyptian cotton...
