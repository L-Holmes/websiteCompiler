            # work out fundamentals
- Users prefer looking in the centre of the screen
- Initial impression is what counts 
- Humans are obsessed with video
- Humans like natural looking (unstructured, no obvious edges, everything muddled together, curves -> transparency etc.) 

# work out the aims
- make money?
- inform people?
- advertise by making the design optimised? 



But what is it that people want?
- interesting design to interest them?
- find stuff as fast as possible?
- do we prioritise all users? Technical users? Everyone? 

Do I design for me? 


-------------
Purpose:
- Make me money
--> advertise
~~~> get people talking 
~~~> give good brand reputation 
--------> smart, functional design 

--> sell products 
--> 



Yep 
You don't say 'i want to give users a good seamless and low lag experience'. Why is it I want that?  
You say: 
- I want to be proud of the website
- I want to enjoy using my website
- I want to fix all the issues I've had with other websites
- I want 



Suckless approach? 
- do the minimal to allow users to best achieve their goal, with minimal complexity, 
- then add just enough to add visual interest? 
- minimal? Easy to look after codebase? (Less code = less money spent) 

Yeh, I think I'll probably go with the 'suckless for me'
- address issue I have (no annoying complicated terms, just base words. No wasted words, good consistent filtering with only one way to filter, no decisions, intuitive design, familiar, whilst optimising in pitfalls) 
- focusing functionality, timelessness simplicity 
- I think it's important to spend as little time & money as possible on the website. There are some super cool websites it there, but you get used to it and it adds very little to someone's life. Possibly a bit more advertisement, but not worth all the extra effort. 
That is a different set of requirements. 

It's also a talking point, because it reflects the whole reason I made this website. 
People are subconsciously obsessed with how things look, at the compromise of functionality, without them even knowing.
Just enough design, and optimise the function. 


Everyone should be able to access the website; children to colour blind to true blind, to illiterate.
- should be able to understand intuitively, or find out quickly
- should be able to do what they want, at least 90% of as fast as possible. 

This drives sales, interest whilst also giving a good experience.

Goal of website, for the outward facing advertisements, is to: 'rlminiate the feel/the need to doom scroll through Reddit / YouTube looking for a way to improve your life. Learn everything here, and then get in in the real world we're our brain is meant to be. Meet real people. Make a legacy. 

Use the 95% RULE everywhere.
5% interest visuals (background vid), 95% pure speed. 
5% inspiring language in key areas, 95% straight facts. 
Can something be shown in an icon/IMG/gif that 95% of audience will understand / be able to quickly learn? (E.g. shivering person to show cold) 
Etc. 

--------
Basic things that add Impact:
- transparent / layering

# Video games!
- Its UIs. People often optimise video game uis, and conform less to expectation. 
    - So they are the perfect source of inspo for my website!
    - they more often keep things minimal and aesthetic.
    - so i analyse what makes them good. Ignoring images and aethetics and breaking down the layout
    - then thinking how well that translates to [simple] code, minimalism, etc.

#also!
Instant answers for common queries as user searches in search


=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================



# website page design
- 80% filter, 20% sorting, rounded boxes 
--> onclick: take up full screen. 
--> on mobile will need the search button to exit out of that (and possibly an 'x' to close?) 
--> help at top right, showing the gif etc. 

- 'add to reading list' to replace my usual 'open in new tab' strategy???? To view things side by side??? 
(Or is it just bloat for something that is already solved by the browser...) 

- no titles- they know they're in the products page 
- buy now button has a shine effect. Make it obvious. 
-> animated button bouncing off the walls, as well? Make it a bit of a game to click it?
(Get publicity as well) 

- increase bounding boxes for clickable buttons so people can get to them easy? Rather than aiming 

- filter for the pages? Like an 'all pages filtering page?? Because I thought perhaps a drop-down I  the top bar... But that's probably too bloated.. 
- deffo have the page for the caveman paleo life 'average day' .. they would eat at 10am so our bodies probably optimally evolved to eat then... 
(Then mention about ageing things and cancer etc. and how they need special non-paleo attention...) (add that to the initial recommended reading page) 

- blog: expand slightly? Just give a little more info? Or like less wrong??? 

- 'related blogs' at bottom of items page, vice versa for items?? 


- think: what are my aims for this page?
(What are my slightly revolutionary ways to do that?) 
- users aims? Read blogs faster? Not wasting their precious time? Minimising their network and electricity usage? Get the info as quick as possible? Find the right item/blog they're after quickly? Buy stuff? Quickly know what to buy? 
--> how can we optimise for those aims without coding too much and keeping things fast? 

- Todo: inspo from YouTube, Amazon, Tesla? Toyota? Netflix.. eBay.. apple.. IBM... Sony.. Google.. Panasonic... Nintendo.. 
(Big tech companies that have invested a lot of research into optimising  sales etc.) 

=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
# filter design
- Search bar is super important, especially for people who hear about a specific product. 
--> discover ability also important there. (NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR MAKING THE HOME PAGE BLOATED THOUGH!?!) 
- filter much more important than search. I'm thinking because people read left to right that put the filter at the left and make like 80%

# encouraging payments UX checks;


Bad UX (Baymard Criticizes):

Weak autocomplete, hidden filters, missing key filters, poor search results

Low-quality product images, vague shipping info, weak CTAs, missing trust signals

Forced account creation, long checkout, redundant form entry, hidden costs


Good UX (Baymard Advocates):

Rich autocomplete with images, visible/scannable filters, faceted search, synonym handling

High-quality images/videos, upfront shipping info, strong CTAs, visible trust signals

Guest checkout, streamlined/single-page checkout, auto-fill billing from shipping, clear upfront costs


Average online cart abandonment rate: ~70%

Top 10 abandonment reasons:

Extra costs too high (48%)

Forced account creation (24%)

Checkout too long/complicated (22%)

Couldn’t see total cost upfront (17%)

Didn’t trust site with payment info (17%)

Delivery too slow (16%)

Just browsing/not ready to buy (13%)

Website errors/crashes (12%)

Poor returns policy (11%)

Not enough payment methods (9%)

- don't use 'show more', just have whole list or scrollable 
- show most critical filters outside the filter button!?!??? 
- filters sticky; editable after user has scrolled through page and decided to change them 
- for price: no slider. Input values (possibly with recommended), and represent the range with a slider / scale 
- 'email for recipet' should be first thing user enters. 
- continue button non-wrapping. - Have progress bars etc. for multi stage steps. 
- auto advance for e.g. 6 digit entry fields 
- * AIM TO HAVE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF KE7 PRESSES / INTERACTIONS TO BUY *
-> e.g. even as much as strongly encouraging keyboard usage, like a big 'tab' to continue etc. or 'enter' 
- * Clearly display price at all times! * OOH could do a video speed running buying my items! 
- have size guide in the size drop-down itself?!?!
- don't allow 'no such results' when searching. 
- shwo related items in cart etc? 
"You may also like... (Summary why)" 
- add trust: Norton, Symantec, credit card providers, PayPal etc
 - does browser back button return with all filters applied? (Will need add to URL???) 
- don't use 'featured'!?!? People scan for specific things... They don't want features , they want what they want / What's for them. 
- footer? (Help contact etc?) 
- force number keypad on mobile for numeric Fields. 
- movie allow remove cart easy (e.g. swipe or pop up easy box, not tiny x) 
- always visible (sticky) add to cart. 
- 48 pixel minimum size for mappable things. 
- label things like multi step process accurately, abs show what's next. 
- * no such things as 'empty' states* - e.g. empty cart = "your wishlist ready for favourites, click here to find!" 
- filter button must show number of results! E.g. *13*/30 
- * 'search within these results * for when the user has already applied filters! *
- shield icon 🛡️ to show security (not lock) + 'secure' 
- list wait time on contact us page 
- order confirmed page hasubtle links; 'track order'; 'print receipt' etc. 
- email subject:
--> "Awpen #1256 order confirmation: boots, shoes, etc."
- no plain 'subkit' button text. 
- for 3 tier pricing, middle shouldn't be 'recommendes' it should be 'vest for teams or dedicated users'
-> *then top most expensive should be 'dor those who care must about their health* 
- cart should survive network errors
- * low clicks and low cognitive load* 
- undo options. (E.g. for removing from cart / deleting etc) 
- for products, users must know almost instantly / in seconds why they have to get it. Don't make them scroll through whole page. Tldr. 
- provide extra reasons to trust. E.g. why trust us?.rt.c 
- * cool publicity: search box like a terminal. E.g. buy $sappBoot.
Basket $sqppboot. ! *
- * never just icons, always label! Icons are ambiguous and interpret able, unlike text. 
- * every state represented by url * 
- search bar is basically command pallet. E.g. go settings / settings will navigate to the settings page??!
- annoyance: you go to a website and don't find it what a companies about in the first 2 seconds. 
- have most expensive shopping selected by default 
- breakdown why a price was chosen with 'why this price' button. 
- FaQs linked to specific items / blogs? 
- order has shipped email has high click rate!?? Use for advertising etc. ?!?
- suggest filters /. Searches in particular categories as user searches in search bar.

Is black the best?
Is 0.000001% less energy and possibly time for advanced users better? 

My users are trying to gain knowledge or buy stuff. 
My users are trying to minimise their sadness. 
Does black background minimise sadness the most? 
Does it minimise my sadness the most since it requires less of my time than other options? 

I feel adding smily faces / funny things / psychological anti loneliness things will take away from the goal of ultimate suckless efficiency... 
It then becomes something else.. a really crappy tool for minimising sadness. Ideally the user should get inz get out as fast as possible. 

Any amount of distracting visual decreases this. 
The most exciting thing on screen should be what they are looking for... A new blog, an item, etc. 
They get it, then leave back into the real world / using a different tool better optimised to achieve their minimal sadness. 

BOOM! 
Black and basic baby! 
(But also optimise for speed. 
I think speed, in order roof most important things, is possibly the most important thing of all when ranking.
Speed of page load
Speed of user to find what they want (either the button for products, or the most recent blog in particular, or find out about what is 'awpen' , whether worth their time etc.) 

BBOM!

==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================
Initial:
- Determine whether company is legit / whether their time / what it's about
- consoom blogs
- buy products they need (or think about it)

Possible second:
- buy products

Future:
- View *new* blogs (need to quickly know if they have read the newest blog and whether they want to read it)
- view *new* products... (Slightly lesser degree) 

Help etc shouldn't be needed, so not prioritised

==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================

Accessibility on home screen like font size?
--> language 
--> font size???? (Or just let them zoom?) 
--> dyslexia friendly fonts (perhaps annoying to normal people? Hard to read for normal people?) 
--> reduced motion by default (?) 

# font size universal expectations:
- Big 'A+' or 'A-' 
- 'A' in different sizes 



Having pro buttons at bottom so they slide to it?

Will pros even use the opening page????? 


Minimal SVG icons. 


==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================
 


# colouring / graphics
- aim: reduce users time
--> least rendering and loading possible.
- aim: minimal computer battery usage
--> darkest colour possible whilst not having bleeding / jarring appearance 
--> have most of the screen like that

# general
- All things clearly big enough to read
- comfortable reading area = all in middle of screen. 


# placement of items on the page
- aim: not too overwhelming 
--> show a minimal number of elements on screen. 
-------
(Reduce mental effort for speed and happiness) 
1) F reading pattern; particularly for new users, reading stuff 
2) familiar; again, for new users, where they expect things to be
(Optimise for return users) 
3) where the mouse cursor is most likely to be closest they load the page (more for return users, speed)
4) places where the user can blindly flick their mouse pointer to and guarantee click as soon as the page loads (e.g. corners, again for return users) 
------
{
Let's think: initial user goals:
- What the company does
- find things they've heard about (search bar) 

Thus:
- these functions should be in the places that help new users 
} 
----
{
Return users goals:
- read blogs they haven't read yet (most likely new ones) 
- Buy a product that they've thought about and have decided to buy
}
- thus, things that achieve these goals should be in the efficient places, as the user already knows the [simple] layout. 
----



# titling blogs difficult...
Why?
- not just writings. Also pictures and videos
- not just data, but discussions and recommendations and evaluations.
- but also guides
- and maybe even other non-knlowedge related things?!?!?
- "guides" implies telling people what to do, which it isn't
- "library implies reading only, and possibly buying / borrowing"
- "read" implies no pictures and videos and is very abstract
- "blog" implies no videos? (Vlog) And standalone writings (not guides). Also it's a modern non-first-principles word. 

Also:
- I don't like confusing names that require knowledge, I want names from first principles, describing well-used verbs ideally (not new specific words like 'blogs'!) 

Final decision:
- describe the main function, and then imply more. 
"Discussions and more"
"Articles and more" ** 
"Write-ups and more" ** 
"Writings and more" ** 
"Thoughts and things" ** 
"Deep dives" 
"In-depth articles and more" 
"Learning journal" 
"Readings and resources" ** 
"Posts and more" 
"Read, see and watch" 
"Reading and viewing"
"Everything else!" ** 
"Articles and everything else" **

# WEBSITE OBJECTIVES


overarching goals

--> Allow the user to minimise their negativity in life
--> Reflect the principles of the website / brand / company; thus building a brand identity, and giving topics to make media (e.g. videos) on.
--> encourage other people to design websites like this that we can then all benefit off of
--> keep to my objectives and goals of general optimisation.
--> Minimise all of the above for me
--> make me money (but prioritising the above first and foremost).

(A) minimise the user's time

(They use their remaining time to do things which reduce negativity more than browsing through a website)

(B) minimise users power consumption

(give them more money to spend on more important things)

(C) general frustration??

(Minimise the amount of negative emotions, unrelated directly to the above, that our users would face)

(D) make people not dislike it?? (Mainly aesthetics, slight familiarity)
ugly UIs out people off; negative emotions, and uncomfortable for viewers- might even put them off buying. This is part of the functionality even if it doesn't feel so. Also, people less likely to be inspired by ugly minimal. They want aesthetic minimal.
(E) Minimise my time / power consumption / frustration
(A)

(C)

Find/discover what they are after, without needing to think or pause

(E)

code easy to maintain
minimal and straightforward code
no bad frameworks etc.
stuff highly adaptable to change. (Since stuff always out of date in computing...)
???
Speed!?!?
=======
no js?

links for headings instead of filters

make web compiler pre-generate common filtered views? E.g. all shoes, etc... there would be millions o pages then though...

or use collapsible sections...
--> that would cut out like 90% of common queries... And after all, I optimise for common procedures and de-optimise for without...

Hold up.
If I just list every item / blog, alongside all of their tags (either hidden text or you can see), then the user can filter for that tag, purely by using ctrl-f(!)


==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================

# Opening page design


Research:

- every design thing tangentially linked. E.g. game design
- analyzed and bribe down basic design principles, hundreds of have menus, looking at basic structure
- principled of: nice to read arrangements, power consumption, etc.
- familiar and aesthetic whilst minimal.

Failed:

- optimised for just corners and when to see it
- --> looked weird
- --> unfamiliar
    
- animated back ground with everything on top bar
- --> redundant background, wasting load times, bandwidth, distracting, requiring more power... time to make that vid takes away from more important things... harder to maintain the codebase.... etc. doesn't reflect what I'm trying to show- we aren't a video company or entertainment... we aren't trying to impress; we're trying to inform
- --> not as user friendly (top bar wheel and requires aiming), not in nice middle, not making use of whole screen.

==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================

# JUST MAKE IT QUICK AND GET MAIN FUNCTIONAITY - OPTIMISE LATER


Functionality perfect  
Vs. speed to load  
Vs. maintainability  
Vs. blocking js  
Vs. inclusivity...

Minimal js...  
95% perfect???  
Because the real thing is in the content???

Frequent users time is more valuable, so we optimise for them... Who read and know where everything is...

We don't need any filters at the end of the day!!!

Defo perfect it later down the line... It's super low priority...  
IF IT TOOK 20 HOURS TO TURN THE BACKGROUND WHOTE TO BLAKC ID JUST LEAVE IT WHITE!


==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================

# BLOGS  PAGES


Like other pages, have a 'blogs' folder.  
Have sub folders repeating topics  
Have blogs themselves as plain html  
Have a shared CSS file.


--> since each blog has its own html though, user can customise which classes go where, and can even use custom css for a one-off case, when needed.
==========================================================================
==========================================================================
==========================================================================

# FILTERING

- went through many iterations;
    - One with test tubes and where the sticker has the item, the water represents how many filtered
        -> It turns out with filtering, its usually just 'something is filtered' or 'nothing is filtered'. All filtered vs. some are filtered is redundant information.
            -> thus the water gimmick is just a gimmick
        -> Not all things are representable with just images. Images cause confusion and intepretation. Text is the true definer.
    - One where all key things aligned in a column, with explicit labling (name,icon,filter more, info + detail and examples for each)
        - Repeated explanation text was way too busy and ugly.
        - It took up loads of space and made interpreting the filters a nightmare..
    - One with just text
        -> some things can't be represnted well with text. E.g. 
        -> even small icons can increase; quick recognition, seperating (like code syntax highlighting), verification etc...
        -> Decided we need an [optional] option for images. (keep images small when possible. Only large when needed)
    - One with quick access for sub sections
        - e.g. instead of 'red' 'blue' 'orange' being hidden behind the 'colours' filter, users sees the 'colours' subheading with the choosable colours underneath.
        -> Requires more code complexity which is bad
        -> Its barely faster than clicking on the 'sub-filter' icon.
            -> If anything, the additional mental strain of reading more things, and having more items to choose from / scroll through / paginate through would possibly slow the user down more!
        -> Its mainly targetted at more impatient/basic users!?!??

- New requirements
    - Minimise user's power consumption:
        - Must be as see through (black) as possible.
        - Must have as minimal design as possible.
    - Accessible;
        - Text easy to read:
            - Text must be aligned in horizontal rows. (also better on mobile where horiz. space limited)
            - Text must ideally be one of the first things on the filter you see.
        - not confusing:
            - Design must be as minimal as possible. 
            - Minimise repeated elements- particularly text (try use iconography where possible, with a key describing the icons -> this gives a cleaner look and makes it much easier for user to prioritise the important title text for a given filter)
            - Everything must be clearly explained (key for symbols, info icon for specific filters / on-hover tooltip, etc.)
    - Space efficient (user's time? not scrolling / going through sub pages?)
        - Use the space as effectively as possible. No big areas 

- Final design:
    - At top is a key explaining things (extra info icon; filter further icon)
    - horizontal row; [?prod.img] [title] [extra info icon] [filter further icon]
    -> big images have a seperate design, where the image is underneath the title, with the filter next to the image directly (this wastes the least amount of whitespace and allows max. horizontal space for text at top)
    - top bar:
        - Top bar, showing progress in filters has been simplified, again to match convention and avoid confusion. 
    - A note on the 'global' filters;
        - This has been seperated, and has its own subheading with a globe icon, describing how the user can apply filters to all selected things
        - This may be a bit confusing, but I feel that global filters are essential, and seperating them out clearly shows that:
            - toggling 'all' won't affect the global filters
            - they act on all of the items.
        - Plus, this is more familiar- it matches the more generic 'products in top bar, and global filters seperate and at side' approach done by most websites.
            -> thus less mental strain for user, incase they get confused about the filtering system for each seperate item.
    - A note on 'view more' 
        - Just a way to quickly illustrate where and what the filters are, allow quick access to primary filters, and allow for quick unselecting of main filters as the user is scrolling through the page.
        - It also gives context as the user is scrolling through the page
        - It provides consistency, as the top bar when scrolling is very similar to just how the default filters are when you enter the page.
