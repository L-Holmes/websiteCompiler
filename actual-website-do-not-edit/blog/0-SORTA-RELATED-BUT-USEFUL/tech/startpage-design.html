    My questions when visiting a website, in order
    (want to know these as fast as possible)
    
    1) Why are they worth my time?

    2) Proving that they are worth my time 
    2)a) What do they provide in order to achieve those benefits for me?
        i) --> [Enough information for me to understand what that thing is / any specific overview details that are essential to understanding what it specifically is]
        ii) --> What does that [thing] achieve? / How do they achieve your claimed benefit to me?
        iii) --> Why should I believe that the [thing] optimally achieves that? / why should I trust you?
    2b) Why should I trust the team behind all of this?
    2c) Any examples, which I can intepret myself, to decide on whether I agree with your claims? / make my own judgement? 
    3) So why would I chose them over alternatives?
    4) Okay, I'm convinced. Where do I start?
        (Or could this go after step 2 in case they aren't bothered about alternatives?)
        Already convinced? Click _here_ to find out where to begin

    continuous) 
    - Do they prove that they are intelligent people in how they present this info?


-----------

i.e. 
1) What's your claim of how you will benefit be?
2) How are you proposing to achieve that?
3) Proof it will work / why I can trust you



Checks:
- As concise as possible?
- Is the key information out there as soon as possible?
    - (in order to quickly reflect they are claerly logical)
    e.g. 
        - minimising negativity
        - singular place for actionable science
        - grounded in paleo

Key:
- I can say all i want, but at the end of the day the reader will make up their own mind.
- 

--------
possible proof?
- E.g. 
    - What percentage of people gain this benefit from your website? (from a sample of 100 people?)
    - What percentage of people gain this benefit from your website? (who have used other things?)
