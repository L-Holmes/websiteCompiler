# Website must
- Have multiple articles that are useful 
    - Actionable
    - Supported by science
    - Authors who are consitent with their logicness

# Ideally...
- Agree with some of our principles
    - Evolutionary


# Big red flags (even if everything else seems alright)
- Essentially things that don't align with common scientific belief
    - e.g. They believe that jedi are real, and preach about that.
    - e.g. Everything is perfect but they are flat earthers.


# ????
- As a rule:
    - I don't link to websites that:
        - Link to controversial things. 
- WEbsites:
    - Weird 
        - Swearing, sexual things, strange appearance.
        - Just paragraphs of rants
        - Don't read as proffessional
        - People who don't have the morals or thought to fix those issues.. I feel they have a low chance of giving reliable data.

# ????
- Can be specific to a particular thing (don't have to be general...)

# Controversial Author?
- No. 
    - Not just the fact 
    - Anyone controversial is not worth trusting. No person/led organisation would knowingly do things to tarnish their reputation.
    - So these are invalid.

# other ocntroversial (either them or things they link to...)
- Lots of controversial thoughts really. 
- Some odd websites linked 
- Some beliefs that don't seem to align with other scientific findings
- Some of the authors seem a bit 'unhinged' / not trustworthy with how the things are presented...
