- Knowing how to use your money is important
- Money can be used to buy away causes of sadness. That's all it does. 


Why can't we focus on the necessities, and then if certain groups of people want something...
- Food (Healthy, cheap, mostly locally produced)
- Water (Not requiring extreme infrastructure. So what If I have to ride my bike with water from the res or whatever.. At least I don't have to pay extortionate amounts for whatever the current constant high cost maintenance system is doing!)
    - We live in england! Just let people have cheap fixable rainwater collection tools then get extra from a res themselves!
- Hospitals
    - Focussing specifically on: understanding why things happens, prevention (rather than curing after), etc.
- Social interaction with actual nice people
- Crime 
- Housing
    - Extremely cheap to put up
    - Easy to fix and modular; not depending on high maintenance systems (e.g. water, gas, etc)
    - Easy to move
    - If you can storm proof a tent you can storm proof a house surely.

For all of these, have everyone work together, subconciously!
- We all have a garden growing veg. 60 million people growing 5 carrots each... 
- We all know basic medicine 
- 

And teach all of the above to everyone!

E.g.
If I'm updating my kitchen, I think about the minimising benefits I could get from that;
- Make more functional to decrease small annoyances / inconveniences (e.g. get counter at correct height)
- Make the appearance sooth me subconciously
- etc.
The big question:
- I don't spend to make the kitchen functionaly perfect. Because that money will instead go to other things that will decrease the amount of negativity in my life more.
    - Even if that money is going towards me not having to work as much!
- Its:
    - Knowing how much each aspect minimises sadness
    - Knowing the cost of achieving each thing
    - Evaluating the cost/time of that compared to every other possible thing I could be doing with that time/money
    - Then deciding whether it should be done.

# Know what is necessary
- Modern world is we're always preparing for tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes. We always work harder.
    - We invent robots to make cars faster. But then the people who make cars don't stop working and have an easy life. They keep working.
        - They make the robots incrementally 'better' (even though they may not be getting better/much better!)

- Its like in software. I always try and find something that:
    - Has the absolute minimum amount of maintenance
    - Works consistently. Has been designed once
    - Stays consistent with its usage (again, designed once to do one job perfectly)
    -----
    - Its seems maintenance and 'improvement' is constantly happening... Just make things that do one good thing once and don't break / become out of date!
    - At work I'm constantly fixing old broken stuff, changing old code.. it takes ages, costs ages and shouldn't happen.
    - Strive for simplicity and minimal maintenance...

- Its like bridges...
    - The severn bridges take multiple millions of pounds to maintain... 
    - We lived for millions of years without needing to get from edinburgh to perth in 2 hours compared to 4... Why are my taxes paying for that?!?
