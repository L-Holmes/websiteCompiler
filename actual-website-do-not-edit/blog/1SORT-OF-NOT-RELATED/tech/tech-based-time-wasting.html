- You're not an ipad kid...
- You just don't like your time being wasted!



-------------

Watch videos etc. when you're doing something limiting.
	- e.g. eating. you can't do anything else. Maybe you feel lonely etc. 
	- perhaps if you're in somewhere new (e.g. a hotel room) and you're feeling good you don't even need to watch a video...
- same with podcasts- obviously save for when they are also useful in genearl (e.g. in the car)
	- but perhaps not when in nature!
