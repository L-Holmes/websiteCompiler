# compromise

# Be flexible- don't be stuck in the ways.
- Read everything here, and then you can break the rules when necessary...


e.g. 
- Sacrificing my time for social moments with friends and family... all the time...
    - and even with spending hours driving to badminton... I could find an alternative but that's what I want to do!


e.g.2.
- I play badminton even though it destroys my joints... and increases IBS
    - Why, that is stupid?
        - Its the most natural source of socialising for me.
            - I treat myself as a third party, like I'm a life advisor looking at a Non-playable-character (common term for just random person) in a game...
            - I know that if I want consistent socialisation, that is were I'll get it..
            - That is were I'll be authentic...
            - I won't get that in a pub... or a different sport... I just don't like them enough and they aren't as optimal for meeting friends.. for people like me...
            - Maybe i'm wrong. Maybe golf would be better. Slowly learn people.. go out of my comfort zone... starting my own run club...
                - But the barrier to entry is too hard.
                - And I enjoy badminton.
