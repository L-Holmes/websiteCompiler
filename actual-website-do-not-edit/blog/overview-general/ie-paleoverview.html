        <h3> 3 main areas; </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> 
        "Paleo, relating to ancestors, and you"
            - Relevant to...
                - You
                - Hunter gatherers living in huts with primitive technology
                - Our ancesters from thousands if not millions of years ago
        </li>

        <li> 
        "Paleo, relating to modern life"
            
        e.g. Nurture related... Related to modern embarrassment / social expectations built up over the years...
        - Going bald
        - Using the toilet / IBS
        - Using a computer
        </li>

        <li> 
        "Non-paleo related things"

        - e.g. I'm thinking things like modern drugs that slow ageing of certain cells... baldness stuff (for mental health)... red light therapy type stuff...
            -      ... things like the cinema maybe? (things that provide a lot of joy, without having bad after effects)
        - Transport
            - Additional benefit this provides: 
                - Excitement of visiting new places / getting away from places / going to exciting places / getting through modern society in general!
            - TODO: transport or 'use public transport' because it depends on the public transport, where you are going etc. 
                - I guess just 'use transport appropriately'?
        - Limit access to fast, easy pleasure
            - e.g. don't use smart phones, pron etc. 
            - TODO again, should this be a single group category or multiple sub-things, which have the common group as a tag???!?!?!
        - Don't use alcohol
        - Don't do illegal stuff


        </li>
        <h3> ...And then general things that put you in a better position to better achieve the aformentioned things. </h3>

        - Money 
        - Country to live in
