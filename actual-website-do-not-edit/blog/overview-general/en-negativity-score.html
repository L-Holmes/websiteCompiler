aka happiness-score?

Takes into account:
- Peak lifetime negativity (bigger negativity is much worse than smaller, more persistent)
    - + the score over time...


============================
Seperately, the 'ethical score'
- Things like;
    - The intelligence of something being harmed 
    - Death is not bad. Suffering is bad.
        - Sometimes death can cause suffering to those around...

# In human words;

Q) What is the 'negativity score'? Can you describe it for us?

(w)
    - The negativity score is a twin to the idea of happiness.
    - It argues that ...
    - And that is controversial! Many people here that and think it is boring. I would never live my life like that.
        - Highs and lows keep me chacing, keep me working.
(x)
    - It is saying "Instead of a life with great highs and many lows, I'd rather have less lows, and live contently."
    - It is not depression, it is contentness.
        - Contentness is like the positive shine to depression's darkness. 
        - Instead of nothing being interesting, everything is okay, nice and delightful.

(y) 
    - It is a measure of how much negativity is impacting your life
(z) 
    - It is a measure that some people use to rate how good their life is.
(z1)
    - It is a concept formed from thinking backwards;
        - Regrets, and how many old, wise people wish they would have lived their lives... And what many people ultimately strive for after gaining that wisdom.
(z2)
    - With a low negativity score (good), you will never complain. Never feel down.
    - Small moments of joy in life will turn big.
    - You will ironically be able to gain great pleasure from the true lasting sources, such as helping others, and feeling like you are important to society.
    - Every day you will look back on the previous day and be grateful of what you did that day.
    -...
    - That to me is an ideal life. 
    - There are very few intelligent people who stopped doing drugs, who is now in there 80s who encourages that life to others.
        - Because with great highs come great lows. Baseline dopamine.
        - But with low highs and low lows, the highs actually shine more prominantly.
        - And you can then focus on building those highs, without the sacrifice of the lows.

# One thing that often gets missed
- The idea of things like lonliness and boredom 
    - These are also negatives.
    - .. and stress whilst forcing yourself to work for a better future...
    - Its all part of it...
