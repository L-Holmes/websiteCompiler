## Physical body condition looking after (knees etc)
- mention how i did it.
    - Looked into family history
        ->  Identified key struggles I'm most likely to inherit
    - Looked into general reports / statistics
        - Most common illness / afflications 
        --> particualarly things that can't be identified early on in life (as I'd know if I already had them)
        --> Particularly things that align with my blood test results / family history knowledge.
