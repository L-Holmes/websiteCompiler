Use your money if you have to.

evaluate
yes it's good to optimise things, but is spending this time doing this Vs other things
can it be done in just a day? Realistically???? Only if alternatives are terrible should you not use them...

Mistakes:

spending way too long making the filter system I wanted and optimised in my head
making my own compiler???
just the website in general when it's the content that is actually important...
what does my target audience truly care about??
don't spend 3 months building a gift by yourself. Explain to your partner that you planned to do that, but would they prefer you to spend that time with them? We all know the answer.
reminder

2 things;

Learning about the target audience
learning the skills you need
MAKING THE THING THAT WILL DIRECTLY MAKE YOU MONEY.
If something isn't optimal, MENTION THAT BUT SAY ITS LOWER PRIORITY

# Step by step of freetime
As soon as you finish doing work for someone else
0) Unwind if needed
    - If really hard/challenging day... It can be really hard to break out... 
1) Get into the mindset
- Use the quickest strategy to get into the mindset.
e.g. 
    - Talking to others
    - Listening to inspirational podcast
    - Quick run (e.g. 3km, in order to get the lungs going but not overdoing it)
    - Quick walk (e.g. 4km, again, not too long). Ideally with minimal driving and in natural without external stressors (e.g. traffic sound)

2) Do something youre interested in that is actually useful
    - e.g. working on business
    - e.g. working on body / health (excercise)
    - NOT short-term money making that has no chance of building to something bigger and better in the future...
