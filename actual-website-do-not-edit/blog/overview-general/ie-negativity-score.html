aka happiness-score?

Takes into account:
- Peak lifetime negativity (bigger negativity is much worse than smaller, more persistent)
    - + the score over time...


============================
Seperately, the 'ethical score'
- Things like;
    - The intelligence of something being harmed 
    - Death is not bad. Suffering is bad.
        - Sometimes death can cause suffering to those around...



AI doesn't tell you what questions you should ask
AI doesn't tell you your mindset
AI doesn't optimise for logic and rationality

(w)
    - The negativity score is a twin to the idea of happiness.
    - It argues that ...
    - And that is controversial! Many people here that and think it is boring. I would never live my life like that.
        - Highs and lows keep me chacing, keep me working.
(x)
    - It is saying "Instead of a life with great highs and many lows, I'd rather have less lows, and live contently."
    - It is not depression, it is contentness.
        - Contentness is like the positive shine to depression's darkness. 
        - Instead of nothing being interesting, everything is okay, nice and delightful.
