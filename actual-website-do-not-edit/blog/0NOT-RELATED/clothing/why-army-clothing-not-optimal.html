They don't have the same priorities as you...
- Mass production...
- (kind of) cheap...
- They sort of embrace sufferring in a way...
    - But not things that will end a mission (understandable)

They also are more grounded in long term proof (understandable)
And traditional, long term knowledge, building of known ideas... (mmmmm kind of understandable?)

They have to try and convince a lot of (ignorant/stuck in their ways) individuals...
    - Who are people... People generally like stories and proof..
    - So a mountaineer (looking at you, USA!), over a nerdy scientist...
