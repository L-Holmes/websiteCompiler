Cheapest house you can build?

How about over 5 years? 
10 years?
80 years?

Is it worth permananent stuff or is just super cheap and easy better????


why don't we make cave houses with skylights???

-----
Is the cheapest these concrete apartment blocks?
how long do they last?

How about these roman built buildings? Shouldnt they be really cheap?
Or old wooden ones? since there are like a million trees in scandanavia?
