# masculinity to me
(especially despite possible shortcomings)

#1 Stepping up when needed.
- You're nervous in foreign country but partner is panic and overwhelmed? you overcome that and get to safety
- You're afraid of dogs but see scary one coming towards partner? You stand in front and protect.
- You're week and can't fight but someone is harassing your sister? You try your best to stand up for them.
- You're sister is being shouted at by a relative and has nowhere to stay? You drive for 4 hours in the night to get her.
- carrying a wounded friend or family and giving them you're jacket whilst you do so. Even if you're week and cold and hungry. even if you want to give up. 

# is true femininity and masculinity the same? 
- like if a mother looks after her child. almost like masculine energy but that's peak mum.

# when have I felt masculine?
- At badminton; confident in my skills, I'm in charge (gets respect etc), people come to me for help, don't feel anyone is judging or any idiots or anyone above me.
- When I'm charming a woman who is nice who seems into me. (especially if I can do so with masculine things alike deep voice etc). 
- When I get an opportunity to help (driving back to pick Dana up when she's upset)
- When I ran back to ex girlfriend to apologise.... (i.e. when I'm absolutely driven and thinking about someone else and pushing my body and mind without even thinking to make things better for them)
- when I can show off my body I guess.. at least to a degree...
- When I can stand in front / put an arm in front to make whoever I'm with feel safe from [a dog] etc.
- when I can go back to help someone (e.g. flat tyre...) .. especially if woman...
- when I can lead in some way (e.g. navigating on a trip / re routing / handling changes in plans or routes...)
- Comforting a woman in bed when she is lead on my chest- either tired or after helping reassure her... or even just hugging someone in that way. 


# WHAT MAKES  A MAN / DAILY CODE
(interesting that what makes a man is similar to what makes a woman...)


Willing to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of those close to them. 

They aren't ignorant.

They inquisitively listen to others, regardless of there stance (that is nice people, not just ignorant or not nice people, obviously) 

They always try to better themselves. Particular when a key moment comes up. 

Similarly; endure small daily extra tasks selflessly, and without complaint (sometimes without asking if it's obvious *to them*);
- e.g. washing up / collecting stuff from table after group event. Offering to hoover etc.

Acting decisively in moments, without apparent fear or doubt (especially in moments where they experience fear or doubt!) 
- Partner is speaking in foreign country and get flustered (you will have prepared a phrase saying "sorry do you speak English" / "is it okay if we use Google translate?" or you pre-researxh saying how to get a ticket...
- Multiple restaurants closed and backup option closed.
- Train cancelled after you've paid for taxi and stranded there.

Able to stand up when necessary
- e.g. if a leader drops out / is ill.

Able to use words / spreach, particularly in hard times to hype people up / calm then down, in order to save the day / make someone's day
- e.g. child struggling at baseball practice / has an embarrassing moment.
- e.g. Family member gets stressed with people at family event.. even if you don't like them, then for the good of the others and your own day you listen and speak to hem like a therapist... You understand their stress.. now let's go out there...
- e.g. family member stressed when out and say you're at a venue and they have to step out. Assume they want to go in but don't force that option, let them talk it through, say what's stressing them. predict what they would ultimately like to be the best outcome, even if right now they appear to stressed to redeem it. Try and bring in humour if appropriate. show you're there for them. remind them of why they're there in the first place- shared 'love' for that person from the group... 

Helping people out in need when possible and within limits.
e.g. At Res, don't have a wheelchair wife etc. to look after. Notice person ahead slightly struggling with pram on stairs (and they don't seem like a dodgy person!), so obvs help them. 
e.g. Person looks concerned (again, non dodgy looking person), you're not rushing to anything, you're not creepy looking (if it's a young woman), so you check they're alright/if you can help in an easy to 'say no' way. Quick and easy. 
e.g. Partner getting ready for evening and is busy. You *offer* to make them some food / "is there anything I can help with"


In times of personal hardship:
- They tell themselves "I will endure this for the others" "I know life is unfair"
- They don't put there negative emotions on others, but when it will affect them (e.g. they are in bad mood) they explain; "I may not be upbeat as I feel unwell and stressed about the day, but I still care for you and will endure to still be acceptable for you")
- ==> e.g. (Only if it is clearly affecting you) [e.g. let's say you've been balding worried for years but only now is it affecting others [don't mention it's worried you for years. Don't make a big deal out of it, just acknowledge it and apologise, you didn't intend to add stress. But don't make a big deal!    "I am worried about balding, but I know I shouldn't let those emotions interfere with our relationship and over time " (don't apologise for going bald! it's up to them what they think...) 
- ==>  E.g. but if they have an injury on the hill, and they know it's not fatal but walking on it will not be good and it hurts, but they have to carry down their unwell son, they aren't adding to their stress...
