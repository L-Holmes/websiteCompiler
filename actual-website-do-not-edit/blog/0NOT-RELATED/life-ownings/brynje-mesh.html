# What it excels 
## insulation from the ground


## Sweat -> cold -> Sweat scenarios
e.g. 
Minimal contact surface area of the mesh means minimal wet area touching your body when it's wet.
Less contact = less conductive heat transfer. 
It won't dry as fast as something with a  bigger surface area, but theoretically you should be warmer.
Subjectively I've found it to not be that much different than a nice cycling base layer or montbell top for instance. 
OMM's sticky nylon layers can be a bit annoying though... 

## Bulking you up
- Good for adding bulk whilst adding minimal insulating relative to the thickness.
- Can make you look bigger / less scrawny

# However
- I still wouldn't wear it for most things.
- It simply is too heavy
- You can usually control your sleep situation enough to not need the benefit.
- I'd maybe consider the wool one for decreasing microfibers in winter if alone... and know I'll be sleeping and then going for a cold run say, and I'm too lazy to change into something else... 

# thus, scenarios to wear it in
- Someone extremely concerned about their scrawniness
- Situation where you may have limited ground insulation when sleeping and/or you are going to bed when it's warm and it get very cold over night. (still ideally not optimal for the weight though.. Only like extreme conditions...) (It's ideal for at parents house in winter though!)
- Someone extremely sensitive to sweaty garments touching them.
- Someone who prefers the mostly wool net for a more natural base layer in high output stop start cold situations.
