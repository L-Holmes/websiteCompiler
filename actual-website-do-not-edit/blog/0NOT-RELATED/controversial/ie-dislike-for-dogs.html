Ban all pets but especially dogs. 

- costs us millions
- dogs are likely sentient, so many are treated cruelly. And even from just being left indoors etc. it's like prison. 
- dog poo
- dogs attacking people
- dogs making people like me uncomfortable / giving bad experiences. Postmen etc. 
- just annoying with the barking etc. always makes me jump. Distruptive
 Wales people up etc. 



- as mentioned in our 'use our money wise' guide, we could use that money to pay computer scientists (not regular scientists) to research common diseases / causes of unhappiness? 
- but no, we're paying for some idiot to put a nippy chicwawa in their handbag for Instagram likes...



Counter arguments debunked:
- social support. We have the internet for Christmas sake. In the UK there are millions of lonely people organisations. Go to a cafe, live in  a care home. Etc.
If we really have to have special guide dogs who are checked up on all the time to check they aren't being mistreated. 
- security. Come on. In 2025? You know how many breaking happen in well secured houses? Surely that's the only thing to consider right? 
- happiness. You think you need a dog for happiness. You are wrong. Our ancestors lived for millions of years. They are like phones or sugary snacks  you think you need them you don't. 


Final words:
- dogs are like slaves. They have no choice and no real freedom. Just because you treat yourself well doesn't mean there aren't thousands of not millions out there who aren't. If you would choose to sacrifice the unhappiness and cruelty to thousands of living and possible sentient beings, just for you to have a fun pet accessory, which is really necessary for happiness, I think that is extremely selfish and cruel.
