we dont often think of money as time anymore... because of fixed wages etc..


Train ticket cost $5.
Walk takes 40 mins.
Train takes 10 mins
train is a 6 minute walk
train to desination is 4 minute walk
you get paid $10 an hour.
Lets assume you didn't spend extra time at uni...


total time:
- Train = 20 mins
- Walk = 40 mins...

but it took you 30 mins to make the money to get the train.
So the total cost is actually:
- Train = 50 mins 
- Walk = 40 mins...

And one is nice and relaxing and you are free and you are getting healthy movement for your body.
The other you are slaving away for someone else... inside. stationary.





same with cars and parking and petrol and insurance and driving lessons...
    - so much of society wasted...
obiovusly extreme exampel and doesn't work for super long distances..
this is simply an example of money is time.
