# theory:
green lush places  attract us.



# + Best natural farming land?
- Fertile
- + long growing season...

# Or.. best for where we would be likely to find edible plants...
# Or.. best for where prey may lurk (lots of grass etc.)


# Why?
I'm obsessed with places that naturally feel nice.
That tap into natural instincts.

I come back from italy / portugal to england and am just amazed by the lush green grass.
Even near the lake district I'm still amazed in my own country in Summer..
    - Like you can't even imagine the lush green... Its just stunning...

Places like the Triglav national park look really stunning.
Same for Iceland... Svalbaard... The desert...
    - But are they homely?
    - Am I at maximal peace?
