Living somewhere flat is evolutionaey depressing.

Humans subconsciously prefer hills and mountains, here's why.

Q)

I and many other people from hilly regions don't like living in flat areas.
Many people go on holiday to mountainous areas.

Evolutionary, why is it that humans are attracted to hills and mountains??

What benefit do areas near them have? Particularly looking at central eastern Africa?

It just seems against what you'd expect. It makes sense for liking water / river, as that was essential to living, but surely mountains means less visibility for prey, less prey in general, poor areas for veg??? , difficult to navigate, can't see far..

my theory

is it that places near mountains have:

--> more fertile soil

--> more animals??

--> more plants due to more rain?? / Better farming?

are other beneficial things, like trees and water etc. usually closer to mountains than flatlands??

other ai suggestions;
vantage points?
caves for protection
in Africa, low lying areas intensely hit and humid... Less windy, more mosquitoes
more water near mountains
due to multiple climates within a small area, bigger variety of plants and animals = more protection against drought / one thing going bad.
more fertile soil (particularly volcanos)
