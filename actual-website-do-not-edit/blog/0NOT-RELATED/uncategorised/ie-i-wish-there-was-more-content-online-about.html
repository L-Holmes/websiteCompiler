Things I shouldn't do..
- Where I shouldn't go...
- What I shouldn't buy...
- Why 'x' is bad...




People who have actually reviewed a lot of other things...
- Been to a lot of places.
    - e.g. been to multiple places hiking in different countries then gave a statistical ranking of best to worst, based not on vibes or food etc. but actually how good it is for hiking and activities and english speaking etc.
