days out trips;

## Primary Aim
- Something that:
    - Provides great emotional resonance (most important!)
    - Does something for the person you are with. (e.g. If they've always wanted to go the the eisendrache castle...)
    - Has high probability of providing at least 1 or 2 exciting shared moments
        - e.g. hole in one; hitting bulseye; hitting strike; sunset; etc.
--> How this can be done / additional things that may be nice to incorporate
    - Unfamiliar / slightly novel setting
    - Away form stressors (like busy roads etc...)
    - Variety
- Actually have fun! 
    - This is a good time to give meaning to life / create good memories and stories

## How people experience interesting things
- Unique (looks different / never experienced before / slightly different etc.)
- Variety (lots of different things)
- Relative to everyday life (you are comparing subconsciously against what you are used to)
- * This is a repeating point for a lot of human psychology! *
- Does it matter how different it is?
- i.e. Creating natural 'highs'
- + Big emotional social aspect as well....

## Point about emotional moments
- Humans social creatures -> Create social moments 

## For our team personally.
- Evaluated many of our trips.
- What it isn't;
    - Money based 
    - Driving / Big travels
    - Massive big changes
    - Lots of lesser moments, for a stereotypical 'Big High'
- What it is;
    - The strongest days out are the ones that are a backdrop for social connection.
    - The best ones;
        - Create at least the minimum amount of scenery change and novelty to light up the brain
        - Give many oppurunities for high-points. Times to celebrate with the people around you. And to talk about.
        - Give things to talk about 

## Planning
- Time 
- Money
- Most people only have 1 big holiday per year...
