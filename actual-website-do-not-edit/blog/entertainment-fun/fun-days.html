Give me a bullet pointed list, in order best to least promising of concepts from TV shows / YouTube videos or series / board games, that are proven, tried and tested, that fit my params. 
They MUST be things that last longer than 1 second and have high chance of randomness and creating social moments / even maybe laughter! 

e.g.  <USE THES EXACT FORMAT>
