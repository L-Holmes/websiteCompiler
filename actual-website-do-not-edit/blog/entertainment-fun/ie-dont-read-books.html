obviously some stuff you can read, skim through, absorb faster...
- just a lot more logical and easier when researching etc...


but especially long form things... Like books and podcasts... they are just full of so much fluff...
why would i read when podcasts exist
    --> very overly verbose
    --> It takes so much energy!
