(very england / me focussed... lol)

# Main things we get out of them
- Socialisation (possibly the most important)
    - Just having good chats.
    - / Not being lonely
    - Also Including:
        - Who you meet (nice people, not nice, oppurtunities for jobs / help etc.)
        - Long term friends (possibly crucial if close friends!)
- Possibly for finding a partner
- Excercise for long term health

# Negatives to consider
- Some are bad for long term health. 
    - Particularly joint health
    - Particularly head health (from head bangs, etc)
    - Sometimes even just general injuries (either inflicted, like cuts... or ripping muscles/tendons etc.)



# Best for socialising 

# Best for meeting partner
- (false thing about gym classes / yoga etc!)
    - Mostly people you wouldn't want to date!
    - Mostly mums etc!
    - You *need* passion... Dont fake it, it is hard to not make it obvious as women are better at detecting......
    - Still not out of the question though... I'd say woman are more likely to recommend you to their friends and their friends' single people they know (relatives, children, friends, etc.)
