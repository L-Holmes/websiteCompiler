# MOST OF THIS GUIDE DOESN'T APPLY TO SUPER SOCIAL EXTRAVERTED THRILL SEEKERS
# (mainly for more anxious / normal / conscientious people)... If you've already considered 'travelling' this isn't for you.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Possible benefits of a holiday
- opportunity to subconsciously try some new beneficial thing with your partner that would benefit them and you (e.g. yoga, exercise, just talking about changes to make; minimal living.. etc. which is beneficial because of the big change in brain context)
- breaking a bad habit (e.g. smoking)
- possibly creative problem solving?
- recording / capturing content for a blog / video ... or just being able to make a review about that place online...
- guest for a podcast, lol
- learn something like a dance that you can do with partner many times over on more boring nights? Or learning something that could benefit children!?!?
- vitimin D (anything else?) 

### other things that you can benefit from but you can get at home...
- exercise
- social bonds with family
- social bonds with friends...

# Key guideance
- Always choose:
    - The cheaper option (whilst still achieving the mininmum requirements - i.e. having the memorable moments, pleasing you partner, being enough time to not result in additional negativity afterwards like regret or not having spent enough time etc... that is up to you and what you need.)
    - The less time option?
        - But at the same time, don't be afraid to go more. Big breaks are nice.
        - And in a lot of cases its probably better to go extra with what you do, in order to guarantee with a high degree that you don't regret etc.
        - You're already ahead of 99% of people by even considering these things.. so do what is right.


# Reasons to go on holiday (at face value) 
- To appease your partner (this isn't as negative as it sounds)
    - Partners don't always have the same minds as us
    - But a great partner is indisinguishable and can generate so much joy just through a few sacrifices of logic...
- To appease the modern day pressure of regret
    - There no point ignoring it. 
    - We've all crossed that barrier, hear from others... Given ourselves an expectation of what we need to do to have a fullfilling life.
        - Dont hide from that and regret it. Embrace it but be intelligent about it.
- You have the money and time.


# Hmmm particularly international holidays
- People don't speak your language...
    - Social moments are what make things

What's the point of holidays? Are they just a dopamine hit? some variety for us spoiled people? 

I just think like if hypothetically if there was a drug that didn't have side effects that gave you the same thrill but at home... people would judge that and I'd never do that. Because I know it's just chasing a high and then after that, sure first day or two at work may be better but after that back to normal. It doesn't achieve my main aim: Minimising lifetime negativity. It doesn't decrease future negativity in any way... or even work towards doing that... 

Building a few very close bonds... (which can be done locally! and no! It isnt stronger and won't make statistical difference doing something more challenging!)..
working on bodily health.. therapy.. Protecting joints.. working on some goal of self employment.. etc. 

I think we just give ourselves these expectations so we feel we have to go on holiday and if we don't we've wasted our time off... 

and evolutionary our ancestors didn't travel far. They lived a close fulfilling family life... 


So why do I want to go in holiday?
- Well 

let's break this down logically and rationally. 


- our ancestors:
- --> Did migrate, go to new places for rituals,.etc
- --> they didn't love the boring monotonous slave life that we live... So holidays kind of adapted to tackle that and give meaning.. 
- Extreme reset 

==================
Would just say the forest of bowland be enough?
Enough to context switch (i.e. move location which seems like a really strong thing in the brain)
But also:
- Minimises wasted / non optimal travel time
- Still get good night's sleep
- We'll assume cheaper...
- No stress of foreign language... 



==================
Well why do we go on day trips? 
why do I go badminton / clubs???

# [other stuff]







Why am I trying to chace the best time? 

I should be optimising for sheer minimising cost, no? 

Time is fixed. 
Cost can be changed. 

But here's the deal: 
- By going with good company to somewhere new... You're already reaching 80% of the enjoyment... Having 2 big moments and you're at 95%... that's not 2 really amazing... 2 really expensive.. it's just  2 unique moments... 


Xnjkgh;
- Instagram stories....

# So
- Achieve basic requirements:
- --> contactless shopping... 
- --> English speaking
- Plan the 2 high points...
- Minimise cost.

Or use it for something else...
What can I achieve on that trip? 
- fitness
- (I know I won't work...)
