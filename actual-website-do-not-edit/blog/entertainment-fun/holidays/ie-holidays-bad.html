# MOST OF THIS GUIDE DOESN'T APPLY TO SUPER SOCIAL EXTRAVERTED THRILL SEEKERS
# (mainly for more anxious / normal / conscientious people)... If you've already considered 'travelling' this isn't for you.





# Reasons to go on holiday
- To appease your partner (this isn't as negative as it sounds)
    - Partners don't always have the same minds as us
    - But a great partner is indisinguishable and can generate so much joy just through a few sacrifices of logic...
- To appease the modern day pressure of regret
    - There no point ignoring it. 
    - We've all crossed that barrier, hear from others... Given ourselves an expectation of what we need to do to have a fullfilling life.
        - Dont hide from that and regret it. Embrace it but be intelligent about it.
- You have the money and time.

# Hmmm particularly international holidays
- People don't speak your language...
    - Social moments are what make things
