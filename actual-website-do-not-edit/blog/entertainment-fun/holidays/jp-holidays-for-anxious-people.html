# Kenya thought experiments
- I've watched a lot of content from Tim Lindon on youtube.
- The video that captivated me the most was probably this:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J4ZWduKKHo
    - Ishara Mara camp, Masai Mara, Kenya
- Why?
    - I guess the natural human origin aspect entices me a bit to be honest... lol.
    - The fully natural materials in the hotel (again, one with nature)
    - The uniqueness compared to other adventures
    - The social aspect of all of the happy looking guest staff etc.
    - The fact that animals - one of the best non-people entertainment things to look at in my opinion, was a big focus.
    - Watching the stars at night has always been something I thought would be great.
    - The great service and food.
    - The peacefulness / away from modern society.

But... after thinking... I don't think it would be my perfect holiday...
In fact I think I wouldn't like it!
- Expensive
- Uncomfortable at points (lack of sleep, general temperature regulation, etc)
- Lack of variety
    - + None of the city / sites / natural area exploring I like...
- Suprisingly car focused at points...
- etc.

## Day 1 (13h flying, 3h waiting) 
Flight to Nairobi (11h 30m) 
OR from London; (9h) 
Internal flight (45m) 
- suncream if not already
- Meet the squad + weird orange drink
- [maybe some slight banter but difficult with culture barrier] 
- Jeep ride (bit loud, dusty, bright), views of just flat empty plains
- maybe see a couple zoo animals
- go over the river 
- watch the group dance
- See the nice room (again, very nice. possibly not max comfort temp / sound wise?). Pretty cool in way in. Although arguably more like a place I'd want to live rather than a short term wow factor!?

## Day 2 - 7? 
- Spend a lot of time inside?
- --> can't really just wander about or travel to new places
- --> don't want to spend too long trapped ina  jeep driven by someone else- not ideal for socialising etc.

## sleep outside night
- Temp control really difficult
- Probs won't get much sleep
- night pee nightmare
- Woke up by wildlife etc. 

Overall;
- A lot of it is still just watching things. Things that are not too amazing? Zoo animals (which is nice!)
- But;
- --> Can't really get close to the animals
- --> involves cars
- --> Can see animals (or even feed!) at the zoo
- Travel will be brutal
- The whole thing will be very cool and immersive, especially in the first day, assuming I'm not too paralysed from the travelling and toilet situation. Still not life changing, just cool and wild and authentic
- I think a few things you'll get used to after a few days;
- --> African savannah
- --> Hot temps
- --> The room
- --> possibly the Jeep rides and some of the animals 
- The other people will be slightly interesting and new, but I can't imagine having rivetting exhilarating conversation, like you would with friend or close family. and it's not a bond you'll be using anywhere else in your life.
- It will be quite quiet which is nicer but it's also enjoyable to be in the crowds when you choose
- There probably won't be a lot of unexpected moments. like you kind of expect to see the animals, you exclaim and then move on.
- obviously food will be an issue
- mosquitos etc.
- I'd probably feel awkward with all the people just lined up. 

Highlights;
- Exclaiming at

Biggest drawbacks;
- Unbelievablly long traveling
- Comfort essentials (sleep, heat) I feel will be sacrificed. 
- Doesn't create social moments. Mainly just first-see interesting things that work well on camera
- Doesn't have the unexpected moments
