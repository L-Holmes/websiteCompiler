whats the point of kessock bridge which much cost loads and only saves like 15 mins? Like sure those 15 mins will add up buts its not like that 15 mins will make a difference to each individual person's life. and not many people make that journey.
How do other bridges (particularly expensive ones) compare time saving wise?
Like surely if its that bad you just build stuff closer or make stuff different. Like its only massive companies that will be losing from transport costs right? Why would we prioritise that over like health care (without getting too political!) It just costs so much and the maintenance costs a bomb!
Its just tax payers paying for big companies to make slightly more money. So basically turning tax money into lining pockets of rich people? because for everyone else the difference is minimal. Sure it creates jobs but like come on! Just let a private company do a boat or something for really desperate people / for an experience? Like they could be working on something with more direct impacts on minimising sadness, no?
how much would it cost in today's money? How much is the yearly upkeep? What kind of 1-1 would that result in if that money went to say helping people socially / medical research / medical purchases?
also for a few of the other major bridges in england. Like surely a custom helicopter flight or a second clinic etc. would be better?
e.g. Like I feel 90% of the bridge use is unecessary leisure use.  Like sure if I could get to london in 1 hour I might go more but at the moment I don't. I'm happy here.  Just build stuff close to where you need it and let the rest be more inefficient and spent by .. and then the rest of us will naturally choose to do less trips out to the trafford centre...
