- Commands ideally have English phrases associated to make them easier to remember (e.g. 'save', 'quit', 'empty', 'new', etc) 
- speed is paramount
--> not reaching far to numbers / ctrl etc. 
- not depending on outside control keys (ctrl, although, etc.) Let them be used by other programs. Also some terminals get messed up by alt etc. 
- generally try and be suckless
- try and reduce down to a minimal number of concepts (e.g. 3 variations of paste, rather than insert and delete and paste) 
- no interference with the code you are reading (no highlights etc) 
- beginner friendly (start in insert mode, allow typical ctrl z / c / v / s / q etc.) 
- minimal non-ergonimic things (r.g. holding down shift keys...) 
- things that should be handled by external programs:
--> searching (select all and pipe into search??)
--> global searching
--> finding other files 

- no bloat (e.g. tree sitter etc. )
- autocompletion I'm torn on
--> most of the time, typing the actual sentence itself is comparable in speed to actually waiting for the ghost text to appear and completing that. 
--> it can detract from my own creativity and ideasz which  is bad
--> ai etc. generally has bad code.
--> only really want snippets and maybe context from the current file, like kakoune. 

- not loads of different ways to do things. Keep the toolbox simple. 
- minimal number of 'reacting'. You know what you want to do, you do it. 

- easy ISH to implement in neovim
- not overly optimised for speed and comfort. Maybe someone else can do that.
I prefer getting 95% there, whilst having compromises. 
Again, I don't think this is optimised, but it's what we came to


=====================

Jump line and find:
- get to right place 95% of the time in practice.
- shouldn't detract from reading the code
- should be a minimal number of 'reacting'. You should be able to see the point, close your eyes and get there...
