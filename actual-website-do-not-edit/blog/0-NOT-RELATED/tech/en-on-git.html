# first off
Bad name.
Git is an insult in english.
'Old git'
'Grumpy git' if you like illiteration...

# also..
bloated (so many things i don't use?)
inefficient commands (waste so much of my life typing these things out...)
--> Not optimised for the most common use case...
still has the silly vim-editted messages.
merging is an absolute nightmare...
etc. etc. etc.
