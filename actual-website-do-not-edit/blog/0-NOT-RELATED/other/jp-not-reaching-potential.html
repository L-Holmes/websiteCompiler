# people with potential 
I don't blame anyone for not reaching their potential.
People happy in life are forced to think. 
When I'm with others, socialising.. I'm not thinking. I'm in the moment. 

# my origin. / Timeline of Awpen. 
It was pure luck that I got here. 
It was pretty much;
- I saw the struggle dad went through with knee problems.
- I researched and hypothesised how to prevent that.
- I researched every possible common issue that people face... Which can be intervened...
- basically, early on it was preventing old age ailments...
- that evolved slowly into minimising sadness...
- for many years this was dominated by IBS...
- many about shoe creation and ultralight until 2025 when it became clear that, despite being important, there's but a lot we can do, but there are other things that we can, which appear to be more important at the moment.... 
I had always known it. A guy quote I love is that when you listen to someone you admire talking about life advice... It's not always that you're learning something new.. it's that they are confirming what you always knew, deep down.


2025 was the year that I realised that deep down, I wanted to help people.
I recognised the joy. The call to help. 
Just trivial things like broken down cars, being their for clearly nervous people... Writing badminton guidance... 
One of the best blessings you can have is to know that someone is happy you're in the world. Sometimes they may not know it know... But hopefully you can recognise that.. it's at least try to get to that point. 

# A statement regarding other non intelligent people and not judging / why I'm putting this information out there. 
I'm not here to judge. 
I'm not certain I'm right. 
But I feel that putting this information out is the right thing to do. 

No one deserves to be judged. 
I've known people from many backgrounds and that has allowed me to see the world from a more whole perspective.
