- I admit that cars can bring happiness in this modern culture
    - some discussions:
        - World has come very car focused.
            - (Albeit Less so than america)
            - Many friends moving out
            - Trick that you feel you can stay in the same place
            - Wanting to leave your home time for whatever reason...
            - The car sort of makes it workable...
            -     and it seems worth it...
        - What a car allows for:
            - See family
            - See friends
