- I'm too scared of cycling on busy roads.
- almost no route is free of busy roads.
- I'm embarrassed to go out on my Brompton.

Where is realistically use a bike;

- cycle to tennis
- cycle to badminton
- cycle to Sainsbury's??  
    In all but one of these, a regular bike is fine.

When it's not useful;

- trips with partner (use rented / shared bike)
- cycle to tennis
- cycle to leisure centre
- cycle to supermarket
- going to the office
- going to Bolton badminton
- going back to family...

================================

# === Final list ===

## Biggest against reasons

- Too embarrassed to ride it. [90th]
    
- --> just the site of people looking at me
    
- --> some youths may laugh
    
- --> I can't rule that out. I can't justify it to myself. I've tried and failed.
    
- Cycling in general is not practical. [70th] Too scary, dangerous and embarrassing. Also too inefficient as you're avoiding busy roads / the entire town is designed for roads. If I have to get to badminton by 7, would I take 1 hour in my drive, or 2.5 hours, including 1 hour of cycling through Bolton in the rain, on double parked streets? Having no flexibility if I feel ill?
    

## other against reasons

- I simply don't go on / desperately want to go on the trips where it would be useful... [60]
- Big cost [50]
- Most of the trips I'd do are compatible with regular bikes.
- even more embarrassing and cumbersome for supermarket shopping!

## biggest reasons for:

- can get picked up by anyone with a car, stick my Brompton in the boot, and carry on.
- can go on bus / cycle travels
- can easily get train with bike. Bike to train station, hop on without issue, then bike somewhere when I get off

## only useful for:

- bus -> cycle situations
- train -> cycle situations
- cycle -> get picked up by someone without a bike rack (or taxi, hire car, etc) ****
- going to a place where you can store it inside (if too risky to lock outside)

## maybe I'm wrong

- maybe I could get over the embarrassment... Like the embarrassment of running.

## Other notes

- it's useless around town. You can't bring it in shops or libraries without getting either straight up conflict or being super judged. I can't go to boots. Sure I could try and find a lamppost to chain it to...
- I've literally been hyped up to use it, and then didn't for one I dthe above reasons, and because I have a car.
- I've literally never used it alone. Only twice with sister. That isn't going to change into the future.

===========================  
I love my Brompton.

But I'm being forced to get rid of it.  
I'll summarise now and elaborate later.  
is because:  
....

Now, you're probably thinking "well you're just a softie who can take a joke and had never had to ride a bike in a real city before"..  
Well...

- I have done lots of cycling in and around. I've commuted to work by bike every day, which is something only 1% if people can claim.
- I was lucky enough to live in the pre-mobile era where as kids we would cycle around town as the time.
- I may be a softie but I feel in a reasonable softie. Cracked open head and helmet. Hitting a tree before the road. Seeing someone get hit by a car. Kids putting branches in spokes.
- [hmmm do I put this at the start?]

Now, back to embarrassment.  
I've mainly lived in the areas of Lancashire and Cumbria.

===============================

 
DO I SELL MY BROMPTON??!?!?!
- I literally went as far as to take pictures and everything...
- Literally have had multiples times considering using it and said no...
- literally haven't used it once.
- I think the decision is clear.
- SELL IT!!!!




===============================
===============================
===============================
===============================
===============================

- Even now... I've told people about the decision, and they've asked me why.
    - "I'm just too embarressed to ride it"
    - "But why? Loads of weird bikes- no one's judging, they are about themselves..."
    ---> "You said so yourself that it is super functional.. so why not?"
    - And i just have to say... 
        - I know. But there has been times when I've wanted to go out, and haven't.
        - That isn't going to change. Me hoping that isn't going to change.
        - I have to look at myself from the first person.
- And even then a certain event will pop up and I'll think or say "ooh that would be perfect for the brompton..."


# the truths;
    - Cycling in england is scary
    - The fear of embarrassment, no matter how valid, is scary.

- If I lived somewhere that:
    - Didn't have anyone around to judge (or a load of brompton users)
    - Didn't have any cars...
- I'd be using my bike all the time! (well, I'm always in a rush so maybe not all the time... but still...)
    - (Also shopping trips are still quite difficult.
