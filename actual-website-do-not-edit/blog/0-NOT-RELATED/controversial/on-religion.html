# Religion is useful
- Maybe less people have been sinful because of religion
- It is fantastic for bringing the community together...
    - Although maybe we don't need false stories to do that...
- I guess it is a ploy to help convince [less convincable] people to actually be nice...
    - And again, maybe it worked
    - even in modern day people like stories and good speakers over facts and logic I've noticed...
    - Maybe its just the ultimate ploy, beyond even my comprehension...



# evolution
- We listened to ourt pasrents religiously (pardon the pun) because what they learnt kept them alive.
    - Hunting, fishing, animals, dealing with other tribes, etc.
- We still have those instincts... but they are now wasted.

Religious practicies that waste resources and time.
