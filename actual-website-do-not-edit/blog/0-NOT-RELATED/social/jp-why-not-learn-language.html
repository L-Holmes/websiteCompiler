- Takes 10 billion hours
- English everywhere anyway
- I don't have to go abroad to feel happy.
    - Its the people. 
    - I don't regret not having epic memories of when I was 5.
        - I have plenty of other memories.
        - I wouldn't replace my memories of uk holidays with that of the canary islands. Like that's not something I'm desperate to do.
            - But I and my family have more money... less stressful moments... learnt more about our own country... learnt more about potential places to live...
