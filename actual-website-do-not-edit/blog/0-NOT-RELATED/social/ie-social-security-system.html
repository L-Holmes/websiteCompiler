Is it a good idea?
what china do?

Benefits:
- People who aren't criminals but are absoltue bell bonkers will be peanilased for being idiots
- Actual nice people who go unseen are rewarded.
Drawbacks;
- People would hack the system
- People would get teased for being nice etc. 
- People who aren't nice would appear nice... (making actual nice people mich much harder to spot!)
	- there would be youtube videos on how to appear nice...
	- then like job interviews... you no longer would be able to tell whos who...


How about just cameras everywhere?
Befefits
- No crime would go unseen
Limitations
- majority of people are evil or untrustworthy. (see the blog on online secrecy)
