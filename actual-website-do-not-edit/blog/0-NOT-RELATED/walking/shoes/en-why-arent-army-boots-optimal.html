# But they are sort of optimal for what they're made for!
    - Mass, cheap(ish) production
    - Stopping mission ending injuries
        - Like calf issues!
    - Navigating through difficult terrain with stupid amounts of weight

Not made for:
- Long term health
- General usage...
    - Walking across flat ground...
    - Walking up stairs
    - (even like 80% of paths in england dont reach the steepness that causes issues with calves... Like I experienced at Sedbergh when off path...)
-
