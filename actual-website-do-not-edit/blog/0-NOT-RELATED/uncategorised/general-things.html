Arguably 'more obvious', but we think that is unfair given how different everyone's lives are...


Some points:
- Leave a bad job
- Sort any health conditions
- Leave bad friends
- Leave a bad family... where possible
    - TODO - convincing bad family members to be better? Resources for if you are in that environment and no easy way out?
        - Maybe some additional encouragement for even if its not all the time...



Random principles
- Loneliness is better than negative people or bad influence
- Leaving early almost always better
- Justify things logically so you can never regret
