## --> Houses
- fallingwater
    - Nice integration of landscape + naturalish looking aesthetic

## --> Cathedrals (europe)
I like cathedrals as:
    - they are the one of the few architecture pieces made to invoke just awe and community
    - Whilst still looking more 'natural' than the modern glass buildings
......................................
- Cologne cathedral, Germany
    - Mainly the size 
    - Very tall facade as well
- Sagrada familia, Spain
    - The obvious choice
    - Almost too popular?
    - Reminded me as a child of the 'Space-time towers' in pokemon movie 10: a rise of darkrai.
        - Even though now I appreciate there is much difference.
    - Very tall nave 
    - Very tall facade (also to me, i think in real life this is more impressive than just pure height)
- Sainte-Chapelle, France
    - Amazing stained windows
    - It lights up the whole world in a blend of synthetic and natural coming together
- Notre Dame, France
    - Or the similar, but perhaps bigger and more statue'd Amiens Cathedral
    - Just like the apperance...

### High facades
- Cologne cathedral
- Ulm minster
- Strasbourg cathedral
- St Michael's church, Germany

### High naves
(I always thoughts that creates an impressive interior)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_church_naves
- Beauvais Cathedral, France, 47m

### UK christian buildings
- St Pauls (big, impressive looking)
- Lincoln (One of the largest non-spired churches..., )
    - In a similar vein...
        - Westminster abbey (pretty high nave)
        - Canterbury
        - York (Also in a nicer town...) (pretty high nave as well)

A note on Liverpool
- Theoretically, very good:
    - Nice interior
    - One of the largest non-spired churces (i.e. better on the facade / 'sheer size' factor)
    - Highest nave of a cathedral in uk
    - longest cathedral in world...
- Just annoys me the weird, slightly phalic shape of it...
    - And the fact that it was built so recently but looks the way it does... it had such great potential..
    - and partly that its in liverpool.

# Other Temples / Buildings etc.
- Chinese / East asian style;
    (I've always quite liked this style...)
    - donglin temple

# Sculptures
- Michaelangelos david

# Art, in general
- Having the art work paint a story.
    - Always something new to find.
    - Many elements that express emotion.
    - They dig into deep human psychology I think. With the emotional/story aspect of them.
