A short poem to myself;

"
I'm not bothered you make 100,000 a year.
I'm happier now than I would be in your position.

[free time]
You trick yourself into thinking money is happiness.
Money can buy you out of negativity...
Money can buy you small moments of joy...


You may think you feel happy, and not realise that your down times are related. 
Many rich people still do things like washing up etc. and complain about it.
They buy fancy cars etc.
I bet you don't own a basic Toyota. Or the cheapest possible car you could find... 
Evolutionary, we are tricked into thinking the cool stuff is what we need. And it's really hard to break away from that. 
But long term happiness is the actual key. 

I may get jealous, but I know I shouldn't.
