- create the V effect
- Shoulder bulk without warmth;
- --> brynje
- --> things that appear loose / tight
 fitting base layers *on top*


Indoor ideas;

i.e. if you have a non-perfect part of your body
Examples:
- Slightly knock kneed
    -> Those looser fit stiff jeans that wrap around the leg
    -> Or... looser fit joggers etc...
