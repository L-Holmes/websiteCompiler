# Complimenting something they are insecure about

- dont over compliement / over justify
- Try to mention it not after an insecure self criticism

------------------------
0.5) Acknowledge the feeling (if they mention it as "don't like my ...."
    - Sounds like thats something youre self conscious about...
1) You perspective
    - "I really like that about you"
    - "[It might sound crazy] but _I_ genuinly find it attractive"
    - NOT "not its not / youre wrong"
2) specificityy
    - I love the way it...

3)?? ?????
    - I honestly would be miffed if it changed...
    - I think it'd really be cute if our child has it...
        - and maybe my eyebrows! imagine!
        - All our best bits

4) Acknoledge their doubts
- I know you may not see it the same way..
    - I genuinly would be happy for you to have [a different feature] and have it change to yours.
        - I would like you more and feel more attracted.
------------------------
OR
just keep simple;
- "I'd love it if our child had your .... its so cute"
- "shall we plan our perfect child and what features?
    - I think... your [eyes/other obvious nice things], + [insecure thing] + other nice things
    - Then something unique about you, that is one of your better features...
- In fact.. the entier [area of face], it all just works so well together.

## Why like this?
- People who are conscious' minds will generally reason that:
    - You're only saying that to make them feel good
        - (and secretly acknowledging its bad...)
    - You're the only person in the world...
