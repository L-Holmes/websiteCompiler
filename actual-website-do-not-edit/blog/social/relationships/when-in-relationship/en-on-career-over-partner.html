### On career over partner 
Also I don't get the idea of rejecting women based on things. 
A woman who is no stress and gives you years of stress free happiness is much rarer than a job or career. going from 60k to 90k can't buy you happiness for most people. the benefit of a great partner is leagues above!?!? And same with career. like am I going to only look for computer scientists??!?! and thus spend 80 years of loneliness looking for the 1 in a million who may not even exist who is one who also has all these other features? 
also, on kids, I thought statistically like 80-90% of woman wants a child!?! and so waiting to find one who doesn't again risks losing everything and doesn't seem logical to me.
