# ...
- Unpredictability + Novelty
- (+ comfortability where it counts)
- (+ minimising negatives / maximising time)
- (+ build lasting social connections) 

Theory:
- Do big early on in relationship.
- --> Not too early. Want certainty, comfort, not rushing, time to plan, etc.
- --> not too late (complacency, less added initial spike of interest) 

Target:
- Months 3-18 (i.e. Feb 26 - May 26) 

Why?
- You remember the start of the relationship better. The insane dopamine of early interactions. Theory: It will combine with the big adventures.
- You'll then both have those stronger moments sealed into your brain.
