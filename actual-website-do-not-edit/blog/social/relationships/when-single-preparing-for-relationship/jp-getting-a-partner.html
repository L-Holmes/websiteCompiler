# Dating strategies
## Recommendation
- In person
- Friends if possible? e.g. ask their partners if anyone is single at work who may be suitable...
- Socialise as much as possible and ask around...
- Dating apps as last ditch effort

## Dating apps
In concept:
- Best way of getting a matching partner

In reality:
- Most users are those who you should avoid
- Because of large numbers, and the fact that it may be difficult for you to show that you are a nice person (people will have lots of different expectations and things that they may avoid which may make them not swipe you...)
- Low chances of meeting that person in general....
- Kind of just luck.
