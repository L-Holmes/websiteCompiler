Loneliness creeps up.
Its not even obvious that its loneliness to a lot of people...

# evolution
- Never alone...
- If we were... oh dear...

# My experience
- I noticed a pattern of enjoying solo walks with lots of other people around... having a good time and enjoying nature like me...
    - like a run at derwent water... or in the peak district at mam tor...
- I wanted a job were I didn't talk to anyone. Thank god I didn't get that. 
- Being alone in Kendal...
