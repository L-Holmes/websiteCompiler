- Show, don't tell, with how you speak.
    - "That is so cool! You're so funny!"
    -> "*gasp* Look at the detail, the way the leaves are arranged, it just calms me...?" 
    - or describe what vibes it is giving you inside that may not be obvious- how its affecting your mood, making you think about etc.

<h3> Conversation strategies <h3>
Don't compliment something that they know.
Notice something specific about it that others don't.
E.g. "you're really good at running / badminton" vs. I can see you dig deep, you've clearly made smart choices with.
E.g.

It has to be believable and genuine.
--> People know if they're not good at a sport
--> people know how good looking they are... How much body fat they have relative to others... Their flaws.
So either avoid those or point out a small specific thing (not a statistics, but emotional, or something specific they've done..)
e.g. I don't think you're fat vs. you're fashionable.. I know you won't believe me when I say you're attractive regardless of body fat... Don't blow things out of proportion when the rest of you so good...
e.g.2. You're good at badminton... Vs. I noticed you active at the net in that game... Well played, you're getting better.

Have the mindset that it's impossible to convince someone if something. They have to realise it for themselves.
You have to be nice, empathetic, drop in facts / resources, ideally related to your own story(?) i.e. not directly related to them. Talk about personal things.
You should only theorise "I wonder why that is? What do you think they meant? [If not response] maybe related to xyz??"

Find out what they crave.
If they're nerdy, they probably want their intelligence complimented.
If they're a model, they've likely heard loads of generic compliments about their appearance...


<h3> You can practice flirting on anyone <h3>
- How you talk to someone you want to attract can be applied to anyone.
- Its very similar to just the same as making friends.
