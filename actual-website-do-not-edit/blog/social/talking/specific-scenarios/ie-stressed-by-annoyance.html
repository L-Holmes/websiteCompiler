## Reminder of just best conversation practices in general

## Common things to keep in mind
- Too much:
    - "You've been treated unfairly" -- May work; may make them feel more sad/angry at the injust
    - "That sounds really annoying"
- Saying it'll get better
    - Obviously good, but may come off as ignoring the problem at hand. People mainly subconsiously want their emotions to be resonated with
- You justifying the other person's actions
    - Right now, in this emotional time, you are on _their_ side, no matter what.
    - Let them theorize why others may have done something, not you.

## General rules
- Don't be reading off a script
- Don't repeat the same thing each time
    - e.g. "That sounds really annoying"
- Try to tailor you response specifically to what they said
    - e.g. 'When they said that to you.. what is she even trying to achieve?'

## Formula

### Before they have mentioned

#### Not talking about it but you suspect something up, but have no idea what
- Pre:
    - Where have they been recently?
    - Who would they have encountered that could have affected?
    - Anything else that may have upset them ? (e.g. bills)
    - How is there family recently?
- e.g.
    - "Everything alright? [I care for you- would you be able to]

#### Not talking but you supsect its related to something they aluded to previously (e.g. a dispute at work)

#### They mentioned something specific earlier, and you are pretty sure its related to that (e.g. going into work after dispute day before)

### Whilst / shortly after they have said what happened
1) Read the sitatuation
- Is it solvable?
- Is it an emotionally stressfully charged situation?
    - e.g. Injustice?
    - e.g. Treated unfairly at work?
- Is it an emotionally challenging charged situation?
    - e.g. Parent with bad dementia
- How are they feeling?
    - Loss of hope?
    - Anger?
    - Sadness?
    - Worry of lots of future sadness of having to keep enduring that?
- Is it a mainly a non-emotional / no-people directly involved issue?
    - e.g. Water leakage / car crash / house burned down / etc.
