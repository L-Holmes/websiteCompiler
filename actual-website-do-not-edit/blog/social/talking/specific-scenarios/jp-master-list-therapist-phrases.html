 0- try and get some education resources that are made for therapists to mention phrases to say
 - try and find people online who disagree with psychology/therapist language and have differing views
    - (these are usually the truly thoughtful individuals who are ahead of their time, truly care about their subject and have thought beyond what others have said to them)

TODO, just for the ABOVE
- filter out obnoxious / patronising ones from the above list
    - + group together similar ones
- these aren't really optimised to be honet


-------

instead of 'manipulating' -> behaviors to get your needs met at the expense of others’ (doing something impulsive to obtain a short term want or need without considering the long term consequences (actions harmful or helpful when thinking about the impact on relationships, increased shame, reduced problem solving, etc.) 

attension seeking -> connection seeking...

struggling with -> experiencing 

good/bad -> Pleasent / unpleasent

issue -> topic

comitted suicide -> died by suicide

that must have been traumatic -> 

how did that make you feel -> "what comes up for you when that happens?"
                           -> "what was your experience with that?"
    (quite difficult to avoid!)
    (bit robotic / patronising / non-natural)

That must feel -> "I can imagine that feeling..."

I think -> "I'm wondering"
        -> "I'm noticing"
        -> "perhaps"
        -> "I'm imaginging that"

Do you understand? -> "am i making sense?"
    (may come off as you are just smarter than them)

Why ... ? 
    (may seem acusationary)
    e.g. why did you do / say that?
    (try and use instead; Who, what, where, when,etc)

Good / Bad food -> more nutritious / less calory dense / lower sugar etc..

I'm sorry (youre going through that) -> That really sucks...
                                   -> I imagine that is really...
                                   -> thats so crap
                                   -> god that sounds so difficult (to deal with)
                                    -> Its rubbish you had to deal with that 
                                    -> I hate that is happening to yuou
                                    -> I can't imagine what youre going through...
                                    -> Yeah, that's not appropriate that they did that. I see why you feel that way. It was also pretty tacky they did that.
    - Not necessarily bad, but can feel emotionally detached

"What you're trying to find out is not the same as what you say"
    - E.g. "why did you do that?" is what you are trying to find out
            - But it reveals.. or implies a judgement that what you did was wrong, as if it was right, they wouldn't need to gain additional understanding.
