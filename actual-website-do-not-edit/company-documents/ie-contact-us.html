# Priority contact
(patreon etc)


# Slightly laborious stuff to filter out people 
  contacting us

# Actual contact details
## (Note on confirmation emails etc? / expceted how long until we get back? (Like average response time historically and recently)

WE DO NOT HAVE A MINIMUM RESPONSE TIME

HOPEfully in the future we will have a page that updates saying how many emails we have got through
So that you can look at the unique ID of your email and work out how long until your response from us.

## Note on us not getting back
    / not getting back with enough detail
- Unfortunately, the contact us we get a lot of questions.
- These are low priority for us, compared to other company things
    - Why? Most are not essential
    - Most are questions about things out of interest
    - Or just confusion over something that they may eventually stumble upon
    - Essential things (like product issues) Have their own contact system to seperate them
    - We don't want to sacrifice the more important stuff for this. We want to give you the best stuff possible. De-prioritising contact lets us achieve this.
