We know we said we don't like complicated words... or things that can't be explained in plain english...


But there are some terms that we use to reflect things we mention a lot, a which have quite wordy definitions / may be interpreted differently depending on the reader...

<div>
    Best life
    <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="'best' meaning minimal negativity score, by our definition">*</sup>
</div>

<div>
    Happiness
    <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="We think of hapiness more as 'contentness' and having the best 'negativity score'">*</sup>
</div>

<div>
    Negativity score
    <sup class="info-tip" data-tooltip="A score reflecting how badly negative emotions impact one's life">*</sup>
</div>
