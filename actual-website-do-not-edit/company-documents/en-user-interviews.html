        <li> What are the *goals* of the user? 
            e.g. 
                - What are they trying to achieve in life?
                - What are they trying to fix?
                - What do they want to do with the product / knowledge they have gained?
            NOT:
                - The 'problems' they mention about their life
                - Problems they mention with your product/service
                - Their proposed solutions (they are prioritising and don't have your general overview)
        </li>
