            <h3> Examples of advertising </h3>
            <h4> Extreme feet (whilst something related to a point I'm trying to make) to prove something </h4>

            <ul>
                <li> 
                    * Advert. : Just fake product reviews on Reddit / YouTube
                    * Advert. Cont. : maybe basic product photos / setup on socials to look legitimate
                </li>
                <li> Youtubers for advertising (probs reviewers?) </li>
