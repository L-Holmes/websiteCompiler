Aka 'roadmap'

# Tier 1:
- Get the website ready for the internet as fast as possible.
- Get all main blogs available to read for viewers


# Tier -1:
- Optimise the filtering
- Optimise the appreance and layout of the website


# Lower tier:
- Translations to many other languages
    --> Most people can read english [TODO source]
    --> Our main target audience is for the people from our country. We are english and so write in english and prioritize english people.
- Optimise the 'inclusivity' features.
- Only load javascript on list pages (blogs / products) when user interacts with javascript related things
    - Tags: website_performance, page_load_speed


# Untiered:
- Have a website page containing a table of every single source;
    - Ideally have a seperate list of rejected sources, with reasons why.
    - Table ideally has:
        - Tags for each entry (e.g. 'food', 'lifestyle')
        - bullet points on what we learned.
        - Ratings of reliability etc.



# Now:
- Think of a good, memoerable name for the company
- Start to make youtube videos
- setup website with products...
- setup github to host website
- setup buy me a coffee
- write a book.
