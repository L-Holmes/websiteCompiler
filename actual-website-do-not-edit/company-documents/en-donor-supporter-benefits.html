            --> same for featuring on a YouTube chNnel? If your video promoting me, in a balanced / analytical or positive way, in the start of the video at least gets 10k / 100k / 1m views and link to my channel...
            First of these gets the 'x' deal.

            # More donations thoughts
            - Inspirations of people who *I dont donate to*.... (so i can think about why i don't donate, and what would make me..)
                - Luke Smith
                    - 
                - Wikipedia
                    - Never use it really so not bothered if it goes under using bad practices of not advertising etc....
                - backpackinglight
                    - Almost joined
                    - I think the amount put me off...

            ## Things that put me off
            - Subscription based vs. One time payment
                - (I have done one time payments for services in the past...)
            - Just the amounts are too big... a more reasonable amount would re

            ## Other thoughts
            - Focus on selling knowledge, and the importance of that
                - Additional knowledge and an early start at that knowledge is invaluable...
                - Its like how if I train loads of people to be saints, who then are super intelligent saints... and they train lots of others and do their own things...
                --> then what i have done is infintesimally more impactful that a small donation to a charity...

        Strategies:
        1) Buy one of my products
        2) Patreon
            - People get there name on something... etc.
        3) One off, one time payment, for suggesting topics / experiments, etc.
            - OOOOHHH could you then say that the suggester will get 5% of the profit from the first [year] of that video!?!?!?'s advertisements?!?!??!?
            - 
        ## Problems:
        - Once person has read website they don't need to go back
        - Even if the website is going down, smart people know that there contribution is small and meaningless so it'll never matter... like a vote...
            - So they'll always leave it to the bigger croud because they get nothing out of it.
        - Wouldn't want to make a forum etc. chat?
            - ... like i wouldn't want to hide info behind a paywall.. at least useful stuff.. so maybe additional stuff behind paywall...


        # other rando thoughts:
        - raffle tickets
        - Other things that pushing the law a bit, like a prize draw etc. 
        - "dont want to donate? see if we can convince you"
            - people like to prove wrong
            - + feedback box of why they weren't convinced- what would convince them
       - early access
            - So they are still getting the same as everyone else, just earlier..   
                - e.g. People could review content etc?

        # ...
        - day in the life of a caveman..
            - side by side of each thing in the day... sunlight vs. looking at my lamp etc.
        - BIG DEAL
            - evolution stopped because humans got too good!!!!
        - PLUS
            - mention how we may have special adaptations beyond our ancestors...
                - like eating milk etc.


        # TODO
        - get more giving stategies from restearch
            - particuarly psychological research...
            - possibly could check out charities as well...
        - foindings;
            - people more likely to give to a parituclar individual, rather than anonymouse group?
            - The 'attractive female' affect?
            - People more likely to give when embracing their emomtions
            - "..." ... when feel they are helping a cause
            - People want a story- that they can tell to others...
                - and feel proud to be part of as movement...

        =======================================
        =======================================

        What if... as part of the charity movement (minimising world negativity)...
        ... our first stage is that donations go towards advertisement..
        ... since that is what i would do anyway as $10 doination from one person vs. using it to advertise on facebook and recruit 100 other people who give 50p each, resulting in, $50...
        ... well that has the accidental affect of also just advertising my website and products in general...
            --> But its not as obvious as people will be directed to our charity page....

        ... Its also more likely to garner news stories etc?

        Help the world... and us?
