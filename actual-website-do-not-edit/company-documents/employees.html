            <h3> Hiring </h3>

            <h4> Possibly dodgy strats </h4>

            Part time employment?
            <ul>
                <li> They buy the materials box off of me, they make the item and send it to the shipping point. </li>
                 <li> Upon confirmation, I pay them the fixed rate. (E.g. £40 + £20 for materials = £60 ; then get £60 profit)  </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> concerns </h3>
            - Stealing materials
                - Pay deposite or is that illegal?
                - make it not worth it financially?

            <h3> general rules </h3>
            - 3 warnings
            - lost things worse than just an accidental messup (people stealing etc.)
