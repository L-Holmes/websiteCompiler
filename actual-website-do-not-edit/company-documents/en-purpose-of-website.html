<h3> Purpose of this website </h3>

Increase the probability of our team having their best life
<ul>
    <li>-> Yep, we're not going to hide the truth.</li>
    <li>-> We created ..</li>
    <li>-> But at least we are sticking to our principles...</li>
    <li>-> But luckily we get happy from helping others...</li>
    <li> Giving our team more money</li>
    <li> New people will stay on the site</li>
    <li> New people will be inspired to tell others about the site -> use psychological tricks to keep them -> quick information (short attention span), easy digestable info , etc.</li>
    <li> Giving our team satisfaction</li>
    <li> Repect -> Well organised, logical, science backed-up.</li>
    <li> Aligning with my goals -></li>
    <li> ? -> Reflecting the intelligent theories by having an intelligent design</li>
</ul>

How much emphasis on different goals?
<ul>
    <li> 90% money.</li>
    <li> 10% logic. </li>
    <li> This is actual trivial. The content etc will provide the logic. </li>
    <li> yeah just make it with money in mind, and everything else will work out. </li>
    <li> (the requirements of logic, repspect, satisfaction will keep the money requirement from getting out of hand.)</li>
</ul>
